INSTALLATION:

Thank you for trying duplicity.  To install, run:

        python setup.py install

The build process can be also be run separately:

        python setup.py build

The default prefix is /usr, so files are put in /usr/bin,
/usr/share/man/, etc.  An alternate prefix can be specified using the
--prefix=<prefix> option.  For example:

        python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local
        export PYTHONPATH='/usr/local/lib/python2.x/site-packages/'
        /usr/local/bin/duplicity -V


REQUIREMENTS:

 * Python v2.4 or later
 * librsync v0.9.6 or later
 * GnuPG v1.x for encryption
 * for scp/sftp -- python-paramiko and python-pycryptopp
 * for normal ftp -- NcFTP version 3.1.9 or later, but not 3.2.0
 * for ftp over SSL -- lftp version 3.7.15 or later
 * Boto 1.6a or later for single-processing S3 access (default)
 * Boto 2.1.1 or later for multi-processing S3 access
 * Python v2.6 or later for multi-processing S3 access

If you install from the source package, you will also need:

 * Python development files, normally found in module 'python-dev'.
 * librsync development files, normally found in module 'librsync-dev'.


A NOTE ON GnuPGInterface.py AND MULTIPLE GPG PROCESSES:

GnuPGInterface is used to access GPG from duplicity.  The original
works quite well and has no bugs, however, we have patched the one
used in duplicity.  Why?  Duplicity is not perfect, yet, and has a
problem when handling long chains of incremental backup or restore
operations.  The problem is that the waitpid() call only happens
after all the iterations complete, and with a long chain, that can
be a long while.  Unless the waitpid() call is made, the child process
remains active.  Duplicity's GnuPGInterface is patched to start an
immediate threaded waitpid() for each GPG task, thus harvesting the
task and freeing it's resources in a timely manner.  This does not
affect the operation of duplicity, merely frees resources on time.

Why the note?  Some distro's remove duplicity's GnuPGInterface in
error, thinking that this change is not important.  So, if you have
the problem where lots of GPG tasks are hanging around, check to see
if this has been done in your distro, then, report the bug to the
distro's maintainer and/or package manager.
