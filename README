INSTALLATION:

Thank you for trying duplicity.  To install, run:

	python setup.py install

The build process can be also be run separately:

	python setup.py build

The default prefix is /usr, so files are put in /usr/bin,
/usr/share/man/, etc.  An alternate prefix can be specified using the
--prefix=<prefix> option.  For example:

	python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local


REQUIREMENTS:

Remember that you must have Python 2.2 or later and librsync 0.9.5.1
or later installed.  For Python, see http://www.python.org.  The
rdiff-backup homepage at http://rdiff-backup.stanford.edu/ should have
a recent version of librsync; otherwise see the librsync homepage at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/librsync/.


HELP:

If you are having problems, you may want to try the mailing list.
Duplicity and rdiff-backup currently share a mailing list, so see:
