INSTALLATION:

Thank you for trying duplicity.  To install, run:

	python setup.py install

The build process can be also be run separately:

	python setup.py build

The default prefix is /usr, so files are put in /usr/bin,
/usr/share/man/, etc.  An alternate prefix can be specified using the
--prefix=<prefix> option.  For example:

	python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local


REQUIREMENTS:

Remember that you must have Python 2.2 or later, librsync 0.9.5.1 or
later, and GnuPG installed.  For Python, see http://www.python.org.
The rdiff-backup homepage at http://rdiff-backup.stanford.edu/ should
have a recent version of librsync; otherwise see the librsync homepage
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/librsync/.  For GnuPG, see the
GnuPG homepage at http://www.gnupg.org/.
