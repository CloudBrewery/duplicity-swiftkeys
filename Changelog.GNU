    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py2.6.0
      - Support python 2.6.0.
      - Without this branch, we only support python >= 2.6.5 because that's when
        python's urlparse.py module became its more modern incarnation. (I won't
        get into the wisdom of them making such a change in the middle of the
        2.6 lifecycle.)
      - Also, the version of lockfile that I have (0.8) doesn't work with python
        2.6.0 or 2.6.1 due to their implementation of
        threading.current_thread().ident returning None unexpectedly. So this
        branch tells lockfile not to worry about adding the current thread's
        identifier to the lock filename (we don't need a separate lock per thread,
        since our locking is per process).
      - I've tested with 2.6.0 and 2.7.6 (both extremes of our current support).
    * Update shebang line to python2 instead of python to avoid confusion.

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/encode-exceptions
      - Because exceptions often contain file paths, they have the same problem
        with Python 2.x's implicit decoding using the 'ascii' encoding that we've
        experienced before.  So I added a new util.uexc() method that uses the
        util.ufn() method to convert an exception to a unicode string and used it
        around the place.
      - Bugs fixed: 1289288, 1311176, 1313966

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/backend-unification
      - Reorganize and simplify backend code.  Specifically:
        - Formalize the expected API between backends and duplicity.  See the new
          file duplicity/backends/README for the instructions I've given authors.
        - Add some tests for our backend wrapper class as well as some tests for
          individual backends.  For several backends that have some commands do all
          the heavy lifting (hsi, tahoe, ftp), I've added fake little mock commands
          so that we can test them locally.  This doesn't truly test our integration
          with those commands, but at least lets us test the backend glue code.
        - Removed a lot of duplicate and unused code which backends were using (or
          not using).  This branch drops 700 lines of code (~20%)
          in duplicity/backends!
        - Simplified expectations of backends.  Our wrapper code now does all the
          retrying, and all the exception handling.  Backends can 'fire and forget'
          trusting our wrappers to give the user a reasonable error message.
          Obviously, backends can also add more details and make nicer error
          messages.  But they don't *have* to.
        - Separate out the backend classes from our wrapper class.  Now there is no
          possibility of namespace collision.  All our API methods use one
          underscore.  Anything else (zero or two underscores) are for the backend
          class's use.
        - Added the concept of a 'backend prefix' which is used by par2 and gio
          backends to provide generic support for "schema+" in urls -- like par2+
          or gio+.  I've since marked the '--gio' flag as deprecated, in favor of
          'gio+'.  Now you can even nest such backends like
          par2+gio+file://blah/blah.
        - The switch to control which cloudfiles backend had a typo.  I fixed this,
          but I'm not sure I should have?  If we haven't had complaints, maybe we
          can just drop the old backend.
        - I manually tested all the backends we have (except hsi and tahoe -- but
          those are simple wrappers around commands and I did test those via mocks
          per above).  I also added a bunch more manual backend tests to
          ./testing/manual/backendtest.py, which can now be run like the above to
          test all the files you have configured in config.py or you can pass it a
          URL which it will use for testing (useful for backend authors).

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py3-map-filter
      - In py3, map and filter return iterable objects, not lists. So in each case
        we use them, I've either imported the future version or switched to a list
        comprehension if we really wanted a list.

2014-04-20  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/more-test-reorg
      - Here's another test reorganization / modernization branch. It does the
        following things:
        - Drop duplicity/misc.py. It is confusing to have both misc.py and util.py,
          and most of the code in misc.py was no longer used. I moved the one
          function that was still used into util.py.
        - Consolidated the various ways to run tests into just one. I made tox runs
          go through ./setup.py test, rather than nosetests. And I made the
          ./testing/run-tests scripts just call tox. Now we no longer need nosetests
          as a test dependency (although you can still use it if you want).
        - Added two more code quality automated tests: a pep8 one and a pylint one.
          I disabled almost all checks in each program that gave a warning. These
          tests just establish a baseline for future improvement.
        - Moved the test helper code into TestCase subclasses that all tests can
          use. And used more code sharing and setUp/tearDown cleverness to remove
          duplicated code.
        - Reorganized the tests in ./testing/tests into ./testing/functional and
          ./testing/unit -- for whether they drive duplicity as a subprocess or
          whether they import and test code directly. Each dir can have specialized
          TestCase subclasses now.
        - Renamed the files in ./testing/unit to more clearly indicate which file
          in ./duplicity they are unit testing.
        - Added some helper methods for tests to set environment and globals.*
          parameters more safely (i.e. without affecting other tests) by
          automatically cleaning up any such changes during test tearDown.
        - Removed test_unicode.py, since it is kind of dumb. It used to be more
          useful, but now with py2.6, we are just testing that one line of code
          in it is actually there.

2014-04-19  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/2.6isms
      - Here's a whole stack of minor syntax modernizations that will become
        necessary in python3. They all work in python2.6.
      - I've added a new test to keep us honest and prevent backsliding on these
        modernizations. It runs 2to3 and will fail the test if 2to3 finds anything
        that needs fixing (with a specific set of exceptions carved out).
      - This branch has most of the easy 2to3 fixes, the ones with obvious and
        safe syntax changes.
      - We could just let 2to3 do them for us, but ideally we use 2to3 as little
        as possible, since it doesn't always know how to solve a given problem.
        I will propose a branch later that actually does use 2to3 to generate
        python3 versions of duplicity if they are requested. But this is a first
        step to clean up the code base.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-static
      - Drop static.py.
      - This is some of the oldest code in duplicity! A bzr blame says it is
        unmodified (except for whitespace / comment changes) since revision 1.
      - But it's not needed anymore. Not really even since we updated to python2.4,
        which introduced the @staticmethod decorator. So this branch drops it and
        its test file.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/encode-for-print
      - Encode translated strings before passing them to 'print'.
      - The print command can only apparently handle bytes. So when we pass it
        unicode, it freaks out. There were only four instances I saw where we used
        print, so I figured it was easiest to just convert them to use the log
        framework too.
      - That way all user-visible strings go through that framework and are subject
        to the same encoding rules.

2014-04-17  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~fredrik-loch/duplicity/duplicity-S3-SSE
      - Adds support for server side encryption as requested in Bug #996660
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/consolidate-tests
      - Consolidate all the duplicity-running code in the test framework.
      - This takes the four test files [1] that run duplicity itself (i.e. the
        high-level functional test files) and consolidates their code. Before, it
        was madness. Each one had its own run_duplicity method, with its own
        slightly tweaked features. This should reduce a lot of duplication.
      - [1] cleanuptest.py, finaltest.py, restarttest.py, and badupload.py
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/modern-testing
      - Enable/use more modern testing tools like nosetests and tox as well as more
        common setup.py hooks like test and sdist.
      - Specifically:
        * move setup.py to toplevel where most tools and users expect it
        * Move and adjust test files to work when running "nosetests" in toplevel
          directory. Specifically, do a lot more of the test setup in
          tests/__init__.py rather than the run-tests scripts
        * Add small tox.ini file for using tox, which is a wrapper for using
          virtualenv. Only enable for py26 and py27 right now, since modern
          setuptools dropped support for <2.6 (and tox 1.7 recently dropped <2.6)
        * Add setup.py hooks for test and sdist which are both standard targets
          (sdist just outsources to dist/makedist right now)
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/require-2.6
      - Require at least Python 2.6.
      - Our code base already requires 2.6, because 2.6-isms have crept in. Usually
        because we or a contributor didn't think to test with 2.4. And frankly,
        I'm not even sure how to test with 2.4 on a modern system.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-u1
      - Ubuntu One is closing shop. So no need to support a u1 backend anymore.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/fix-drop-u1
      - Looks like when the drop-u1 branch got merged, its conflict got resolved
        badly. Here is the right version of backend.py to use (and also drops
        u1backend.py from POTFILES).
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-pexpect
      - Drop our local copy of pexpect in favor of a system version.
      - It's only used by the pexpect ssh backend (and if you're opting into that,
        you probably can expect that you will need pexpect) and the tests.
      - I've done a quick smoketest (backed up and restored using
        --ssh-backend=pexpect) and it seemed to work fine with a modern version
        of pexpect.

2014-03-10  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

     * Merged in lp:~germer/duplicity/par2
      - This branch adds Par2 recovery files to duplicity. It is a wrapper backend
        which will create the recovery files and upload them all together with the
        wrapped backend. Corrupt archives will be detected and repaired (if
        possible) on the fly during restore.
      - It can be used with url-string par2+webdavs://USER@HOST/PATH
      - Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/426282

      - Switches the boto backend back to using lazy imports so there are no
        complaints during the importing of backends.

2014-02-26  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~prateek/duplicity/s3-glacier
      - Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1039511
        - Adds support to detect when a file is on Glacier and initiates a restore
          to S3. Also merges overlapping code in the boto backends
      - Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1243246
        - Adds a --s3_multipart_max_timeout input option to limit the max execution
          time of a chunked upload to S3. Also adds debug message to calculate
          upload speed.

2014-02-24  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/pexpect-fix
      - duplicity has its own copy of pexpect. Use that instead of requiring one
        from the system.

2014-02-05  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/gpg-encode
      - getpass.getpass(prompt) eventually calls str(prompt). Which is a no go,
        if the prompt contains unicode. Here's a patch to always pass getpass() a
        byte string.
      - Our tests didn't catch this because they always set PASSPHRASE. I've added
        a test that passes the passphrase via stdin.

    * Reverted changes to gdocsbackend.py

2013-12-30  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/encoding
      - This branch hopefully fixes two filename encoding issues:
      - Users in bug 989496 were noticing a UnicodeEncodeError exception which
        happens (as far as I can tell) because some backends (like webdav) are
        returning unicode filenames from list(). When these filenames are combined
        with the utf8 translations of log messages, either (A) the default ascii
        encoding can't handle promoting the utf8 bytes or -- if there aren't any
        utf8 bytes in the translation -- (B) the resulting unicode string raises
        an error later when log.py tries to upgrade the string again to unicode
        for printing.
      - This fix is largely implemented by adding a wrapper for backend list()
        implementations. This wrapper ensures that duplicity internals always see
        a byte string. (I'd like to eventually use this same wrapping strategy to
        implement generic retry support without backends having to add any logic,
        but that's just a thought for the future.)
      - That is, the fix for issue #1 is completely inside backend.py and the
        changes to backends/*.py.
      - The rest of the invasive changes deal with filenames that may not be valid
        utf8. This is much rarer, but possible. For proper handling of this, we
        need to print using unicode, and convert filenames from the system filename
        encoding to unicode, gracefully handling conversion errors. Some of the
        filenames we print are remote names. Who knows what encoding they are in;
        it could be different than the system filename encoding. 99% of the time,
        everything will be utf8 and we're fine. If we do get conversion errors,
        the only effect should be some question mark characters in duplicity
        logging output.
      - I tried to convert as much of the actual codebase to use unicode for
        printing. But I stopped short of adding an assert in log.py to enforce
        unicode, because I didn't want to go through all the backend code and
        manually adjust those bits without being able to test each one.

    * Merged in lp:~jkrauss/duplicity/pyrax
      - Rackspace has deprecated python-cloudfiles in favor of their pyrax
        library, which consolidates all Rackspace Cloud API functionality into
        a single library.  Tested it with Duplicity 0.6.21 on both Arch Linux

2013-11-17  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~verb/duplicity/bucket_root_fix
      - Fix bug that prevents backing up to the root of a bucket with boto backend.
    * Merged in lp:~gliptak/duplicity/415619
      - Better error message when chown fails
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/log-path-type
      - Any backup browser built on top of duplicity will need to indicate which
        files in the backup are folders and which are files. The current logging
        information doesn't provide this detail. So I've added a field to the
        log.InfoCode.file_list output that includes the path type.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/manifest-oddities
      - We may accidentally end up with an oddly inconsistent manifest like so:
        Volume 1
        Volume 2
        Volume 3
        Volume 2
        As did get reported recently on the mailing list:
        http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2013-11/msg00009.html
      - One way this can happen (the only way?) is if you back up, then duplicity
        gets interrupted between writing the manifest and uploading the volume.
        Then, when restarted, there is no longer enough data to create as many
        volumes as existed previously.
      - This situation can cause an exception when trying to restart the backup.
      - This branch fixes it by deleting any excess volume information encountered
        when loading in the manifest. We discard volume with higher numbers
        than the last one read.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/disappearing-source
      - When restarting a backup, we may accidentally skip the first chunk of one of
        the source files. To reproduce this,:
        1) interrupt a backup
        2) delete the source file it was in the middle of
        3) restart the backup
      - When replaying the source iterator to find where to resume from, we can't
        notice that the file is gone until we've already iterated past where it
        would be!
      - The solution I came up with is to just let duplicity stuff the data we
        accidentally read back into the source iterator.
      - This is actually a data loss bug, because it's possible to back up
        corrupted files (that are missing their first chunk).
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/normalize-before-using
      - Avoid throwing an exception due to a None element in a patch sequence.
      - None elements in a (non-normalized) patch sequence are perfectly normal.
        With the current code in the patched function, it is certainly possible to
        hit a crash due a None.
        See http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2013-11/msg00005.html
      - This branch fixes that by normalizing the sequence before using it in the
        logging code. It's acceptable to bring the normalize_ps() call outside the
        try/except block because normalize_ps is not expected to throw. It's
        relatively simple and doesn't really use its objects besides checking if
        they are None.

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/catch-seq-copy-error

2013-04-27  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~tblue/duplicity/paramiko-1.10.0
      - This fixes bug #1156746, making the Paramiko backend compatible with
        Paramiko 1.10.0. It keeps compatibility with older Paramiko versions.
    * Merged in lp:~townsend/duplicity/fix-1161599-2
      - The fix in revno. 912 didn't take into account that the parameter "body"
        passed into request() is overloaded, so when it was NULL or of a type other
        than file, it would fail.  This checks if "body" is of type "file" before
        actually seek()'ing back to the beginning of the file.
    * Merged in lp:~tblue/duplicity/paramiko-fix-delete-retry
      - This fixes bug #1115715, which is really annoying. Basically it makes
        using the Paramiko backend with the default settings impossible.
    * Merged in lp:~juan-f/duplicity/progress
      - From time ago, there are people asking for a progress bar estimation in duplicity.
        There is even a script that circumvents the issue, getting info from the log so as
        to estimate the progress status ( https://github.com/quentin/Duplicity-progress )
        but does not give enough feedback and the estimation is rather plain.
      - I have developed a set of heuristics that gather information from the deltas and
        the transfer ratios of the backend so as to forecast % of progress, estimation of
        remaining time and average speed, for both full and incremental backup uploads.
      - The current implementation works for boto backend, but to port the other backends
        to use this feature would be quite easy (we can discuss the details if interested).
      - The algorithm is activated by the --progress command line flag, and will perform a
        first-pass dry-run to collect evidence for all the deltas. Next it will trigger the
        real upload, while a thread statistically estimates the ratio of changes and
        compression for the data in/out, and uses these ratios to forecast time remaining
        and % of completion.
      - The progress data will be logged each 3 seconds, or the --progress-rate flag.
    * Merged in lp:~jnoster/duplicity/dpbx-added
      - The application key was approved as "production" one after some changes to the code
        to suit the requirements of Dropbox team (the keys are now obfuscated, for instance).
    * Applied blocksize.patch from https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/897423
      - New option --max-blocksize (default 2048) to allow increasing delta blocksize.
    * Applied duplicity-ftps.patch from https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1104069
      - Don't try to delete an empty file list.

      - Add Dropbox backend
      - NB! In order to use the backend one must:
        1. Install Dropbox Python SDK first.

2013-01-18  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav.fix-retry
      - added ssl certificate verification (see man page)
      - more robust retry routine to survive ssl errors, broken pipe errors
      - added http redirect support
    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav.manpage
      - explanation of webdav changes above
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/pygi
      - Python bindings for the gobject stack (used in the gio backend) have changed
        from static to dynamically-generated bindings. The old static bindings are
        deprecated. So here's a branch to change the gio backend from old to new ones.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py3rsync
      - This branch lets one build the _librsync module with Python 3. You can't
        really do anything useful with it, but it's a nicely-isolated piece to add
        Python 3 support for.
      - The changes are a mix of modernization and #ifdef logic.
      - All tests still pass in Python 2.7 and 2.4. I tested manually that the module
        worked as expected in Python 3.

2013-01-07  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/static-corruption
      - This branch fixes three possible ways a backup could get data-corrupted.
        Inspired by bug 1091269.
          A) If resuming after a volume that ended in a one-block file, we would
             skip the first block of the next file.
          B) If resuming after a volume that ended in a multi-block file, we would
             skip the first block of the next file.
          C) If resuming after a volume that spanned a multi-block file, we would
             skip some data inside the file.
      - A and B are because when finding the right place in the source files to
        restart the backup, the iteration loop didn't handle None block numbers
        very well (which are used to indicate the end of a file).
      - C is what bug 1091269 talks about. This was because data block sizes would
        get smaller as the difftar file got closer and closer to the volsize.
        Standard block sizes were 64 * 1024.  But say we were close to the end of
        the difftar... When resuming, duplicity doesn't know the custom block sizes
        used by the previous run, so it uses standard block sizes. And it doesn't
        always match up, as you can imagine. So we would leave chunks of data out
        of the backed up file.
      - Tests added for these cases.
      - This branch is called 'static-corruption' because all these issues occur
        even when the source data doesn't change. I still think there are some
        corruption issues when a file changes in between duplicity runs. I haven't
        started looking into that yet, but that's next on my list.
      - C only happened without encryption (because the gpg writer function already
        happened to force a constant data block size). A and B happened with or
        without encryption.

2013-01-02  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed 1091269 Data corruption when resuming with --no-encryption
      - Patches from Pascual Abellan that make block size consistent and
        that add no-encryption option to manual-ctrl-c-test.sh.
      - Modified gpg.py patch to use 64k block size so unit test passes.

2012-12-22  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav.fix-retry
      - bugfix: webdav retrying broke on ERRORS like "error: [Errno 32] Broken pipe" in
        socket.pyas reported here https://answers.launchpad.net/duplicity/+question/212966
        added a more generalized 'retry_fatal' decorator which makes retrying backend

      - Allow .netrc auth for lftp backend
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/946988
      - This fixes bug 946988 by not duplicating the checks for when we should ask
        for the password (those same checks are done more correctly inside
        get_passphrase). And add a test to reproduce the bug.

      - more formatting fixes, clarifications in sections EXAMPLES, FILE SELECTION

2012-11-03  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/u1-oauthlib
      - As the Ubuntu packager for duplicity, I would prefer u1backend.py
        used oauthlib instead of oauth.  oauthlib is well maintained upstream
        (unlike oauth), has a python3 port (for the future), and is in Ubuntu
        main (so is oauth right now, but hopefully in the future we can drop
        it to universe, in which case duplicity can't use it anymore).
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/delete-new-sig-in-cache
      - In duplicity 0.6.20, we fixed bug 1031269. This means that we no longer
        leave sig files on the remote location.  Leaving sig files on the remote
        location also caused a bug with deleting cache files. Code used to leave
        remote new-sig but delete the locale cache new-sig; this meant that we would
        keep downloadoing the new-sig all the time from remote. We had worked around
        that by just not deleting the new-sig in the cache, which was sort of the
        wrong side of that problem to tackle.  Now that we handle the remote
        new-sigs better (by deleting them), I don't think we need this code anymore.
        Patch by az@debian.org.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/u1-ascii-error

    - Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/ropath.index
    + This branch does two main things:
    1) Skips base dir entries when compiling the list of deleted delta iters.
    (this gracefully recovers from the sort of situations that lead to bug
    929067). I'm reasonably confident this is an uninvasive change, but
    please confirm.
    2) Overwrites the sigtar file on backup-restart. This is because AFAICT,
    duplicity will rewrite the entire sigtar each restart. But we were
    opening the sigtar file as "ab", so we'd just dump the contents on top
    of the previous contents. Which was causing some confusion in bug 929067.
    If I'm wrong that we don't always rewrite the entire sigtar each time,
    this needs some rethink. Please also confirm that.
    + In addition, I added two tests for the above two changes and make some
    improvements elsewhere in the restarttest.py file while I was at it.

    - Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/leftover-sigtar
    + So currently, duplicity does not delete signature files when doing a remove-all-but-n operation. Seems wrong, since those signature files are now useless and take up space.
    + This branch does several things:
    1) Make remove-all-but-n operate on chains. In practice it did before, since the sets it operated on always came from complete chains (i.e. it never used only some of the sets from a chain)
    2) Add a new method to get all signature chains before a certain time.
    3) Use this new method to also delete signature chains during remove-all-but operations.
    + And it cleans up the cleanuptest.py file:
    1) Removes crufty, unused code
    2) Disallows changing the destination folder for the test, which no one would ever want to do and isn't really supported anyway
    3) Add some additional checks to the existing test
    4) Adds two new methods to test remove-all-but-n and remove-all-inc-of-but-n-full

    If the gio backend wants to ask a question during its mount phase, it previously just aborted. This branch allows it to continue, though not to make an intelligent answer.

    Only two gvfs daemons ask questions: 'sftp' does for new hosts, and 'afc' does for locked device. In both cases, the 0 choice is the 'just keep going' choice.

2012-03-19  Michael Terry  <michael.terry@canonical.com>

    Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/testfixes

    Here are two changes that help the test suite pass (it got broken after the recent round of merges).

    1) When file_naming is asked for a name, don't assert if compression AND encryption are turned on.  They are by default now.  But globals.compression is only meant to take effect if encryption is turned off.  So when encryption is on, just turn off gzip suffixes.

    2) Some tests are unit tests that directly import the relevant duplicity code.  So make sure that regular expressions are setup lazily as needed, not once at the start of bin/duplicity.

2012-02-07  Michael Terry  <michael.terry@canonical.com>

    a couple small code fixes to help tests pass

2011-06-17  Lekensteyn  <lekensteyn@gmail.com>

    - duplicity.1: move information about the PASSPHRASE and SIGN_PASSPHRASE
    environment variables to the Environment Variables section
    - duplicity.1: add information about the limitation on using
    symmetric+sign to the bugs section
    - In the passphrase retrieval function get_passphrase, do not switch from
    "ask password without verifying" to ask+verify if the passphrase was
    empty
    - Allow an empty passphrase for signing key
    - Make clear in the verification prompt whether the encryption passphrase
    or the signing passphrase is being confirmed
    - Fix passphrase retrieval for sym+sign (duplicity-bin and gpg.py)
    - Allow sym+sign with limitation (see comments and manual page)

2011-06-11  Lekensteyn  <lekensteyn@gmail.com>

    - invalid function description fixed for get_passphrase in duplicity-bin
    - function get_passphrase in duplicity-bin accepts argument "for_signing"
    which indicates that a passphrase for a signing key is requested
    - introduces the SIGN_PASSPHRASE environment variable for passing a
    different passphrase to the signing key
    - commandline option --encrypt-secret-keyring=path introduced to set a
    custom location for the secret keyring used by the encryption key
    - manual page updated with SIGN_PASSPHRASE and --encrypt-secret-keyring
    - ask for a new passphrase if the passphrase confirmation failed to
    prevent an endless retype
    - improved some comments in the code
    - due to the difference in the handling of the signing and encryption
    passphrase, the passphrase is asked later in the duplicity-bin

2009-07-01  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    Fixed issues in Checkpoint/Restart:
    * The --name backupname" option was added to allow the
    user to separate one archive from another.  If not
    specified, the default is an MD5 hash of the target
    URL, which should suffice for most uses.

    * The archive_dir (cache) is now stored in a standard
    location, defaulting to ~/.cache/duplicity.  See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/

    * The interaction between the --archive-dir option and
    the --name option allows for four possible results
    for the location of the archive dir.
    - neither specified (default)
    ~/.cache/duplicity/hash-of-url
    - --archive-dir=~/arch, no --name
    ~/arch/hash-of-url
    - no --archive-dir, --name=foo
    ~/.cache/duplicity/foo
    - --archive-dir=~/arch, --name=foo
    ~/arch/foo

    * duplicity will now copy needed metadata from the
    remote store to the local cache as needed.  This
    means that the first use after upgraded from 0.5.x
    will have the metadata copied to the local archive
    dir in order to sync both.

    * cleanup will now work correctly with the archive
    dir and separates the local from the remote files.

2009-06-27  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * change --archive-dir expansion to look for %DUPLICITY_BACKUP_NAME%
    * which in turn defaults to the args hash previously used for
    --archive-dir and %DUPLICITY_ARGS_HASH% expansion

2009-06-22  Peter Schuller  <peter.schuller@infidyne.com>

    * merge from trunk

2009-06-15  Peter Schuller  <peter.schuller@infidyne.com>

    * support expansion of %DUPLICITY_ARGS_HASH% in --archive-dir value
    * default to ~/.duplicity/%DUPLICITY_ARGS_HASH$ so that default behavior
    works well even when the user has multiple backup destinations
    * update the manpage accordingly

2009-06-16  Peter Schuller  <peter.schuller@infidyne.com>

    * significantly re-design the asynch scheduler to be much simpler; instead of keeping workers
    and queues, simply launch a thread for each unit of work, blocking when called for by
    a concurrency limit or a barrier. the old design was a result of initially designing for
    keeping a persistent set of workers, only to then drop that idea. when dropping that idea,
    I should have re-done it like this from the start instead of retaining the complexity
    i introduced for the persistent worker design.

    * GPGWriteFile: what was previously the minimum block is is now just the block size; meaning
    the maximum block size used for individual I/O operations, but still the minimum in terms
    of when to give up on the iteration
    * GZipWriteFile: similar change, though blocksize handling was a bit different

    It's not an option and never has been.

2009-04-09  loafman

    Added tilde '~' expansion and variable expansion in the

    expansion is applied to the source or target URL's.

    FTP backend was failing on PureFTPd when the "-x ''"
    option was removed from the second ncftpls popen, a fix
    that was implemented due to bug #24741.  This fix does
    the ls in one pass by extracting either the first or the
    last entry on the 'ls -l'.  [Standard FTP would be nice!]

2009-04-01  loafman

    After email voting among known duplicity contributors,
    the decision was reached to revert to the GPL Version 2
    license, so with their consensus, duplicity is now under
    GPL Version 2.

    The -vN option has not changed.  Verbosity may also be one

    the mixed-case versions, -vN, -vNotice, -vNOTICE.

    4  log.Notice
    5  log.Info
    6  log.Info
    7  log.Info
    8  log.Info
    9 log.Debug
    The -vN option has not changed at this point.

2009-03-29  loafman

    Revert to calling NcFTP utilities (ls, get, put) directly
    rather than scripting ncftp via pexpect.  Move fatal error
    regarding version 3.2.0 to a warning message since it has
    been reported that the segfault problem does not occur on
    most distributions.

    To fix the above, --use-agent was added as a command line option.
    When this is specified and asymetric encryption is enabled, then all
    GnuPG passphrases will come from the gpg-agent or equivalent program
    and no passphrase prompt will be issued.

    GPG errors will no longer cause tracebacks, but will produce a
    log entry, from gpg, similar to the following:
    ===== Begin GnuPG log =====
    gpg: BAD0BAD0: skipped: public key not found
    gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: public key not found
    ===== End GnuPG log =====
    This will let the user know what really caused the GPG process
    to fail, and what really caused errors like 'broken pipe'.

2007-12-27  loafman

    Added 2nd patch to bug #21475 that forces all versions of
    Python to use the fixed urlparse.py.

    Fixed issue with Pure-FTPd that would always return an empty
    directory listing and thus force a full backup every time.
    A side effect of the change is that we now only make one call
    to ncftpls to get the listing, thereby reducing the overhead
    on systems with a large number of backup files.

    Make sure config.py not checked in.

2007-12-12  loafman

    Initial release.

2007-12-12  loafman

    This test requires a file that no longer exists.
    Plus, it is unclear what this test is supposed
    to accomplish.  Tar is tested by the other tests.

2007-12-12  loafman

    First pass at getting tests up to date:
    -- isolate config in 'config.py' (see config.py.tmpl)
    -- silence noisy tests as much as possible
    -- fix code on both sides as needed

2007-12-09  loafman

    Initial release.

2007-12-09  loafman

    Remove 2nd call to dup_time.settimestr() since it overrides
    the time that may be set by --current-time (used for testing).

2007-12-09  loafman

    Regen dup_time.curtimestr if time-separator changed.

2007-12-09  loafman

    patch #6300: Standard library replacement for ParsedUrl class
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6300

    I had to fix the ssh/scp scheme to remove the leading '/' in
    parsed_url.path, otherwise it tried to treat the path as absolute.

    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?21646
    Fix to handling of collections when --archive-dir is used.
    Prior to this, duplicity would write the full sig files to
    both local and remote, then delete the remote.  Now, it does
    not delete the remote full sigs.

    Applied the following patches from Peter Schuller
    patch #6279, add command 'remove-all-but-n-full'
    patch #6280, clarify --archive-dir option

    'f' for 'full', etc..  A warning message is printed if the short
    command is not unique.

2007-11-19  loafman

    Changes to ftpBackend to use the login config file rather than
    putting the username and password on the command line.  This
    requires the use of NcFTP 3.1.9 or later.

    Thanks to a patch from Greg Hewgill the Amazon S3 backend now
    uses --num-retries to retry IO repeatedly if needed.

    Patch from Mitchell Garnaat to get all keys from S3, rather
    than just the first 1000.

    Fix to sshBackend to version check for python-pexpect 2.1.

    Fix one case in ftpBackend where host string was used instead of
    url_string.  This only affected the creation of the target dir on
    the remote system, if it did not exist, and only if the user or
    port needed to be specified.

2007-09-26  loafman

    Changes for 0.4.4.RC2.

2007-09-26  loafman

    Added --timeout <seconds> (default 30) to allow users to change
    duplicity's network timeout settings.

    Added --time-separator <char> to allow users to change the time
    separator from ':' to another character that will work on their
    system.  HINT: For Windows SMB shares, use --time-separator='_'.
    NOTE: '-' is not valid as it conflicts with date separator.

    Changed usage message to separate options and commands.

2007-09-26  loafman

    Add patch from Olivier Croquette to allow user@domain usernames,
    making ftp://user@domain@domain.com/path a valid URL.

    - full and pubkey enc:  doesn't depend on old encrypted info
    - inc and pubkey enc and archive-dir: need manifest and sigs,
    which the archive dir contains unencrypted

    - listing files:  needs manifest, but the archive dir has that
    - collection status:  only looks at a repository

    Final patch for Peter Schuller's fix to max read size.
    The first one was broken (revision previous to this).

2007-09-10  loafman

    Add patch submitted by Peter Schuller which removes the
    default SSH options that ignored known hosts files and
    disabled strict host checking.  This patch also handles
    the authentication failures from these issues.

2007-09-06  loafman

    Fixed so that max read size is 64k, not the
    volume size which can be quite large.

2007-08-20  loafman

2007-08-20  loafman

    Changes for 0.4.3 release.

    Do not pass :port part of URL to scp backend.
    Its taken as the target file and errors out.

2007-08-13  loafman

    Change ssh_command option to be ssh_options.  This adds
    options to the scp and sftp commands that are used by
    the ssh backend.

2007-08-13  loafman

    Fixed bug 20764 - unable to use port in ssh backend.
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?20764

    Change ssh backend to send 'quit' instead of EOF when
    using sftp.  This allows it to run under cron as long
    as the password is supplied non-interactively.

2007-07-21  loafman

    Changes for 0.4.3.RC11.

2007-07-21  loafman

    Add --ssh-askpass option.

2007-07-21  loafman

    Duplicity now correctly processes scp URL's of the form:
    scp://user@host[:port]/
    where the directory spec is empty.  This fixes a bug where the
    user could not write into the home directory on the target.

    The SSH/SCP backend has had an overhaul.  It now requires the
    python-pexpect module.  Normally this can be obtained from your
    distro's repository, but if you want, you can download pexpect
    from http://pexpect.sourceforge.net.

    The SSH/SCP backend work was done to allow the user to use password
    authentication rather than public-key.  You may now enter a password,
    either through the FTP_PASSWORD environment variable, or at the
    console.  To activate this feature you will need to use the option
    --ssh-askpass on the command line.  The default is public-key, which
    does *not* look for a password from either source.

    patch #6094, Boto Backend Fixes for RC10

2007-07-14  loafman

    Changes for 0.4.3.RC10

2007-07-14  loafman

    Add support for:
    --ftp-passive,
    --ftp-regular,
    --num-retries

    Removed -m option on FTP put command.  This means that
    the remote directory must exist prior to backup.

    Changed ftpBackend from -f option back to commandline.
    Various versions of ncftp* interact differently when
    both -f and commandline options are supplied.

    The FTP password is munged in all log operations.

    Added logging of filenames in the bucket when -v9 is
    used on Amazon S3.

2007-07-14  loafman

    Add support for:
    --ftp-passive,

2007-07-09  loafman

    Changes for 0.4.3.RC9.

2007-07-09  loafman

    Added a commandline option, '--num-retries=<int>', to set the number
    of retries.  The default is 5.

2007-07-09  loafman

    New S3 backend, Boto, from Eric Evans, replaces bitBucket.  Boto can
    be obtained from http://code.google.com/p/boto/.  I did not make this
    a requirement for setup since its not in the normal repositories.

    New FTP backend from Thorsten Schnebeck that uses ncftp instead of
    Pythons ftplib.  This seems to be much more solid.  I added the -f
    option with a secure temp file to contain host, user, and password,
    rather than having them on the command line.  I also added the -m
    option to the put command to create the target directory and the -t
    option to make sure it times out if there is a network problem.

    The Backend class now contains a popen_persist function that acts like
    run_command_persist.  Both use the new num_retries global.

2007-06-29  loafman

    Change to a max block size of 2048 bytes for
    rsync difference buffer.  This may slow things
    down for truly large files, but will give much
    smaller deltas on files with numerous small
    changes, such as database files.

2007-06-28  loafman

    Initial release.

2007-06-27  loafman

2007-06-27  loafman

    Bug 20039 - Andreas Schildbach: --and--
    Patch 6030 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
    Duplicity now uses bzip2 for compression.  This matches the way
    the Debian distribution handles it.  I'll think about adding an
    option to override later, if its needed.

2007-06-27  loafman

    Bug 20282 - Thomas Tuttle:
    An out of range index when checking past history in the backup
    sets caused a failure when trying to access later.

    http://bugs.debian.org/370206
    archive-dir together with incremental backup results in crash. the
    patch is simple, the code in 0.4.2 did attempt to access strings as
    objects.

2007-06-19  loafman

    Patch 6033 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
    let's add a --help terse usage message and don't just direct the user
    to the manual. this should come handy if somebody needs to restore
    stuff without having the manual available.

2007-06-19  loafman

    Patch 6032 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
    a new feature patch: i've recently gotten annoyed with having gazillions of
    5mb files and therefore added a --volsize option to allow the user setting
    the chunk size. the patch is simple and contains a manpage update as well.

    Changes to the bitbucket backend:
    * Update to work with bitbucket 0.3b.
    * Add some docimentation.
    * Implement a suggestion by Ben Escoto to move the access and secret keys to
    environment variables.

    band-aid for issues that should be resolved at lower levels.
