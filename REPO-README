REPO README - Notes for people checking out of Launchpad (bzr)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Getting duplicity to run:
-------------------------

By the numbers:
1) Do the checkout while in a location called $DUP_ROOT:
        bzr lp:duplicity .          [for the dev branch]
   -OR- bzr lp:duplicity/stable .   [for the stable branch]
2) cd $DUP_ROOT/duplicity
3) run "python compilec.py" to create _librsync.so
4) cd ..
5) run "./duplicity-bin -V". You will see "duplicity $version" instead
of the normal version number. Versioning comes during the release.

To run outside this directory, use PYTHONPATH to set the path. 

PYTHONPATH=$DUP_ROOT duplicity-bin

or

PYTHONPATH=$DUP_ROOT rdiffdir


Running the unit tests:
-----------------------

If you want to try some of tests, you first have to untar the
testfiles.tar.gz as root (the tarball contains device files, files
with various uid/gid, etc):

cd testing; tar -xvzf testfiles.tar.gz

Then run the various *test.py files, for instance:

cd testing; python lazytest.py
