Getting duplicity to run:
-------------------------

By the numbers:
1) Do the checkout to a location called $DUP_ROOT:
   bzr branch lp:duplicity $DUP_ROOT   		                  [for the dev branch]
   or 
   bzr branch lp:~duplicity-team/duplicity/0.6-releases $DUP_ROOT [for the stable branch]
2) cd $DUP_ROOT/duplicity
3) Run "python compilec.py" to create _librsync.so
4) cd ..
5) Run "PYTHONPATH=$DUP_ROOT bin/duplicity -V". You will see 
   "duplicity $version" instead of the normal version number. 
   Versioning comes during the release.

Use PYTHONPATH to set the path each time that you use the binaries:

PYTHONPATH=$DUP_ROOT bin/duplicity

or

PYTHONPATH=$DUP_ROOT bin/rdiffdir

Running the unit tests:
-----------------------

cd testing; ./run-tests
