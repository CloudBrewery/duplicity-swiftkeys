CVS README - Notes for people checking out of CVS
-------------------------------------------------

Getting duplicity to run:
-------------------------

If you want to run a version of duplicity checked out of CVS into your
$DUP_ROOT directory, change to $DUP_ROOT/duplicity and run the
./compilec.py file.  With any luck, a _librsync.so library will appear
in that directory.  Then run duplicity-bin, making sure that all the
files are in your PYTHONPATH:

PYTHONPATH=$DUP_ROOT duplicity-bin

or

PYTHONPATH=$DUP_ROOT rdiffdir


Running the unit tests:
-----------------------

If you want to try some of tests, you first have to untar the
testfiles.tar.gz as root (the tarball contains device files, files
with various uid/gid, etc):

cd testing; tar -xvzf testfiles.tar.gz

Then run the various *test.py files, for instance:

cd testing; python lazytest.py
