Look at handling of files with very long names

Raise error/warning when --file-to-restore doesn't match anything.

Think about option to disable gpg encryption.  (Suggested by Attila
Kinali, maybe Dean Gaudet a while ago.)

Think about doing restores file-by-file: download the first volume in
every increment and then produce the first file, then the second, etc.
This would make doing verifies easier.  Also restore would in theory
be more efficient, because, for instance, deleted files would not have
to be created, possibly patched, and then deleted again.
	However, it seems that temp space usage would be a problem - the
amount required could grow to 50MB (volume size)* num of increments.
So 100 days of increments = 5GB max volume size.  This can be reduced
by decreasing the volume size, but that might lead to other
inefficiencies.
