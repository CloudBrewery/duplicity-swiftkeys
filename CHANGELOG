New in v0.2.1 (2002/10/31)
--------------------------

Security Fix:  Fixed bug where an rdiffdir patch containing a path
with a '..' component could overwrite files in parent directory.

Fixed bug where files without a username (only uid) would be marked as
changed every session.  Thanks to Peter Ehrenberg for bug report.

Now files with negative mtimes are treated as if they have mtime 0.
This prevents them from being marked as changed unnecessarily.  Thanks
to Peter Ehrenberg for report.


New in v0.2.0 (2002/09/29)
--------------------------

(Thanks to Peter Ehrenberg for his valuable suggestions on many of the
below.)

** IMPORTANT ** New syntax intended to make duplicity more
user-friendly.  Old duplicity invocation will not work so change your
scripts and read the man page.

By default no local archive dir will be read or created.
$HOME/.duplicity has no special significance.  However, one can be
specified with --archive-dir for faster operation.

If PASSPHRASE environment variable not set, ask user for passphrase
instead of exiting.

The source directory and hostname are now recorded, and rdiff-backup
will complain if you try to back up different directories to the same
location (but --allow-source-mismatch can override).

Changed some of the logging verbosity levels.  Level 5 now lists files
being backed up.

Fixed large file problems.  Files larger than 2GB should be backed up
correctly.

Significant additions to the manual page.

By default, duplicity now chooses whether to make a full or
incremental backup depending on whether up-to-date signatures can be
found on the remote side or local archive directory.  Overrideable
with (-f/--full and -i/--incremental).


New in v0.1.1 (2002/09/16)
--------------------------

Supports asymmetric encryption with GPG public keys using the
--encrypt-key option.

Added option --sign-key.  When backing up, files are signed with the
given key.  When restoring, remote files are required to be signed by
given key.

Now duplicity checks the hash data found in the manifest file.  The
previous version generated SHA1 hashes but did not check them when
restoring.

Fixed GnuPG broken pipe error.  In the previous version certain
partial restores would end with a spurious GnuPG error message.


New in v0.1.0 (2002/08/26)
--------------------------

First real version.
