New in v0.7.00 (2014/05/??)
---------------------------
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/require-2.6
  - Require at least Python 2.6.
  - Our code base already requires 2.6, because 2.6-isms have crept in. Usually
    because we or a contributor didn't think to test with 2.4. And frankly,
    I'm not even sure how to test with 2.4 on a modern system.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-pexpect
  - Drop our local copy of pexpect in favor of a system version.
  - It's only used by the pexpect ssh backend (and if you're opting into that,
    you probably can expect that you will need pexpect) and the tests.
  - I've done a quick smoketest (backed up and restored using
    --ssh-backend=pexpect) and it seemed to work fine with a modern version
    of pexpect.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/2.6isms
  - Here's a whole stack of minor syntax modernizations that will become
    necessary in python3. They all work in python2.6.
  - I've added a new test to keep us honest and prevent backsliding on these
    modernizations. It runs 2to3 and will fail the test if 2to3 finds anything
    that needs fixing (with a specific set of exceptions carved out).
  - This branch has most of the easy 2to3 fixes, the ones with obvious and
    safe syntax changes.
  - We could just let 2to3 do them for us, but ideally we use 2to3 as little
    as possible, since it doesn't always know how to solve a given problem.
    I will propose a branch later that actually does use 2to3 to generate
    python3 versions of duplicity if they are requested. But this is a first
    step to clean up the code base.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-static
  - Drop static.py.
  - This is some of the oldest code in duplicity! A bzr blame says it is
    unmodified (except for whitespace / comment changes) since revision 1.
  - But it's not needed anymore. Not really even since we updated to python2.4,
    which introduced the @staticmethod decorator. So this branch drops it and
    its test file.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py3-map-filter
  - In py3, map and filter return iterable objects, not lists. So in each case
    we use them, I've either imported the future version or switched to a list
    comprehension if we really wanted a list.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/backend-unification
  - Reorganize and simplify backend code.  Specifically:
    - Formalize the expected API between backends and duplicity.  See the new
      file duplicity/backends/README for the instructions I've given authors.
    - Add some tests for our backend wrapper class as well as some tests for
      individual backends.  For several backends that have some commands do all
      the heavy lifting (hsi, tahoe, ftp), I've added fake little mock commands
      so that we can test them locally.  This doesn't truly test our integration
      with those commands, but at least lets us test the backend glue code.
    - Removed a lot of duplicate and unused code which backends were using (or
      not using).  This branch drops 700 lines of code (~20%)
      in duplicity/backends!
    - Simplified expectations of backends.  Our wrapper code now does all the
      retrying, and all the exception handling.  Backends can 'fire and forget'
      trusting our wrappers to give the user a reasonable error message.
      Obviously, backends can also add more details and make nicer error
      messages.  But they don't *have* to.
    - Separate out the backend classes from our wrapper class.  Now there is no
      possibility of namespace collision.  All our API methods use one
      underscore.  Anything else (zero or two underscores) are for the backend
      class's use.
    - Added the concept of a 'backend prefix' which is used by par2 and gio
      backends to provide generic support for "schema+" in urls -- like par2+
      or gio+.  I've since marked the '--gio' flag as deprecated, in favor of
      'gio+'.  Now you can even nest such backends like
      par2+gio+file://blah/blah.
    - The switch to control which cloudfiles backend had a typo.  I fixed this,
      but I'm not sure I should have?  If we haven't had complaints, maybe we
      can just drop the old backend.
    - I manually tested all the backends we have (except hsi and tahoe -- but
      those are simple wrappers around commands and I did test those via mocks
      per above).  I also added a bunch more manual backend tests to
      ./testing/manual/backendtest.py, which can now be run like the above to
      test all the files you have configured in config.py or you can pass it a
      URL which it will use for testing (useful for backend authors).
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py2.6.0
  - Support python 2.6.0.
  - Without this branch, we only support python >= 2.6.5 because that's when
    python's urlparse.py module became its more modern incarnation. (I won't
    get into the wisdom of them making such a change in the middle of the
    2.6 lifecycle.)
  - Also, the version of lockfile that I have (0.8) doesn't work with python
    2.6.0 or 2.6.1 due to their implementation of
    threading.current_thread().ident returning None unexpectedly. So this
    branch tells lockfile not to worry about adding the current thread's
    identifier to the lock filename (we don't need a separate lock per thread,
    since our locking is per process).
  - I've tested with 2.6.0 and 2.7.6 (both extremes of our current support).
* Update shebang line to python2 instead of python to avoid confusion.
* Merged in lp:~3v1n0/duplicity/copy.com-backend
  - I've added a backend for Copy.com cloud storage, this supports all the
    required operations and works as it should from my tests.
  - You can use it by calling duplicity with something like:
    copy://account@email.com:your-password@copy.com/duplicity
  - The only thing I've concerns with is the optimized support for _delete_list
    which can't be enabled here because the test_delete_list tries also to
    delete a not-existing files, and it requires the backend not to raise an
    exception in that case (is this somewhat wanted or could we do the same as
    for _delete or _query?)
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav200fix-0.7
  - webdav backend fix "BackendException: Bad status code 200 reason OK. " when
    restarting an interrupted backup and overwriting partially uploaded volumes.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/webdav-fixes
  - This branch fixes two issues I saw when testing the webdav backend:
  - 1) Errors like the following: "Attempt 1 failed. BackendException: File
    /tmp/duplicity-LQ1a0i-tempdir/mktemp-u2aiyX-2 not found locally after get
    from backend".  These were caused by the _get() method not calling setdata()
    on the local path object, so the rest of the code thought it didn't exist.
  - 2) Some odd issues from stale responses/data. We have a couple places in
    webdavbackend.py where we close the connection before making a request
    because of this problem. But I've changed it to do it every time, more
    reliably, by putting a _close() call inside the request() method.
  - With this, the webdav backend seems fine to me.
* Merged in lp:~antmak/duplicity/0.7-par2-fix
  - Useful fix for verbatim par2cmdline options (like "-t" in par2-tbb version)
* Fixed bug 1327550: OverflowError: signed integer is greater than maximum
  - Major and minor device numbers are supposed to be one byte each.  Someone
    has crafted a special system image using OpenVZ where the major and minor
    device numbers are much larger (ploop devices).  We treat them as (0,0).


New in v0.6.24 (2014/05/09)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Applied two patches from mailing list message at:
  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2014-01/msg00030.html
  "Added command line options to use different prefixes for duplicity files"
  This resolves https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1170161 and provides
  a workaround for https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1170113
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/gpg-encode
  - getpass.getpass(prompt) eventually calls str(prompt). Which is a no go,
    if the prompt contains unicode. Here's a patch to always pass getpass() a
    byte string.
  - Our tests didn't catch this because they always set PASSPHRASE. I've added
    a test that passes the passphrase via stdin.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/pexpect-fix
  - duplicity has its own copy of pexpect. Use that instead of requiring one
    from the system.
* Merged in lp:~prateek/duplicity/s3-glacier
  - Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1039511
    - Adds support to detect when a file is on Glacier and initiates a restore
      to S3. Also merges overlapping code in the boto backends
  - Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1243246
    - Adds a --s3_multipart_max_timeout input option to limit the max execution
      time of a chunked upload to S3. Also adds debug message to calculate
      upload speed.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/fix.dpbx
  - Fix dpbx backend "NameError: global name 'rest' is not defined"
* Merged in lp:~prateek/duplicity/botoimportfix
  - Switches the boto backend back to using lazy imports so there are no
    complaints during the importing of backends.
* Merged in lp:~germer/duplicity/par2
  - This branch adds Par2 recovery files to duplicity. It is a wrapper backend
    which will create the recovery files and upload them all together with the
    wrapped backend. Corrupt archives will be detected and repaired (if
    possible) on the fly during restore.
  - It can be used with url-string par2+webdavs://USER@HOST/PATH
  - Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/426282
* Merged in lp:~fredrik-loch/duplicity/duplicity-S3-SSE
  - Adds support for server side encryption as requested in Bug #996660
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-u1
  - Ubuntu One is closing shop. So no need to support a u1 backend anymore.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/fix-drop-u1
  - Looks like when the drop-u1 branch got merged, its conflict got resolved
    badly. Here is the right version of backend.py to use (and also drops
    u1backend.py from POTFILES).
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-pexpect
  - Drop our local copy of pexpect in favor of a system version.
  - It's only used by the pexpect ssh backend (and if you're opting into that,
    you probably can expect that you will need pexpect) and the tests.
  - I've done a quick smoketest (backed up and restored using
    --ssh-backend=pexpect) and it seemed to work fine with a modern version
    of pexpect.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/2.6isms
  - Here's a whole stack of minor syntax modernizations that will become
    necessary in python3. They all work in python2.6.
  - I've added a new test to keep us honest and prevent backsliding on these
    modernizations. It runs 2to3 and will fail the test if 2to3 finds anything
    that needs fixing (with a specific set of exceptions carved out).
  - This branch has most of the easy 2to3 fixes, the ones with obvious and
    safe syntax changes.
  - We could just let 2to3 do them for us, but ideally we use 2to3 as little
    as possible, since it doesn't always know how to solve a given problem.
    I will propose a branch later that actually does use 2to3 to generate
    python3 versions of duplicity if they are requested. But this is a first
    step to clean up the code base.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-static
  - Drop static.py.
  - This is some of the oldest code in duplicity! A bzr blame says it is
    unmodified (except for whitespace / comment changes) since revision 1.
  - But it's not needed anymore. Not really even since we updated to python2.4,
    which introduced the @staticmethod decorator. So this branch drops it and
    its test file.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/encode-for-print
  - Encode translated strings before passing them to 'print'.
  - The print command can only apparently handle bytes. So when we pass it
    unicode, it freaks out. There were only four instances I saw where we used
    print, so I figured it was easiest to just convert them to use the log
    framework too.
  - That way all user-visible strings go through that framework and are subject
    to the same encoding rules.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/more-test-reorg
  - Here's another test reorganization / modernization branch. It does the
    following things:
    - Drop duplicity/misc.py. It is confusing to have both misc.py and util.py,
      and most of the code in misc.py was no longer used. I moved the one
      function that was still used into util.py.
    - Consolidated the various ways to run tests into just one. I made tox runs
      go through ./setup.py test, rather than nosetests. And I made the
      ./testing/run-tests scripts just call tox. Now we no longer need nosetests
      as a test dependency (although you can still use it if you want).
    - Added two more code quality automated tests: a pep8 one and a pylint one.
      I disabled almost all checks in each program that gave a warning. These
      tests just establish a baseline for future improvement.
    - Moved the test helper code into TestCase subclasses that all tests can
      use. And used more code sharing and setUp/tearDown cleverness to remove
      duplicated code.
    - Reorganized the tests in ./testing/tests into ./testing/functional and
      ./testing/unit -- for whether they drive duplicity as a subprocess or
      whether they import and test code directly. Each dir can have specialized
      TestCase subclasses now.
    - Renamed the files in ./testing/unit to more clearly indicate which file
      in ./duplicity they are unit testing.
    - Added some helper methods for tests to set environment and globals.*
      parameters more safely (i.e. without affecting other tests) by
      automatically cleaning up any such changes during test tearDown.
    - Removed test_unicode.py, since it is kind of dumb. It used to be more
      useful, but now with py2.6, we are just testing that one line of code
      in it is actually there.
* Fixed bug #1312328 WebDAV backend can't understand 200 OK response to DELETE
  - Allow both 200 and 204 as valid response to delete
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py3-map-filter
  - In py3, map and filter return iterable objects, not lists. So in each case
    we use them, I've either imported the future version or switched to a list
    comprehension if we really wanted a list.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/backend-unification
  - Reorganize and simplify backend code.  Specifically:
    - Formalize the expected API between backends and duplicity.  See the new
      file duplicity/backends/README for the instructions I've given authors.
    - Add some tests for our backend wrapper class as well as some tests for

    - Removed a lot of duplicate and unused code which backends were using (or
      not using).  This branch drops 700 lines of code (~20%)
      in duplicity/backends!
    - Simplified expectations of backends.  Our wrapper code now does all the
      retrying, and all the exception handling.  Backends can 'fire and forget'

      test all the files you have configured in config.py or you can pass it a
      URL which it will use for testing (useful for backend authors).
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/encode-exceptions
  - Because exceptions often contain file paths, they have the same problem
    with Python 2.x's implicit decoding using the 'ascii' encoding that we've
    experienced before.  So I added a new util.uexc() method that uses the
    util.ufn() method to convert an exception to a unicode string and used it
    around the place.
  - Bugs fixed: 1289288, 1311176, 1313966
* Applied expat fix from edso.  See answer #12 in
  https://answers.launchpad.net/duplicity/+question/248020



New in v0.6.23 (2014/01/24)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Applied patch from bug 1216921 to fix ignore_missing().
  - merged lp:~mterry/duplicity/ignore-missing to fix patch.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/catch-seq-copy-error
  - Any* exception when running patch_seq2ropath should be ignored (though
    logged) and duplicity should move on. This covers the two asserts in that
    function (bug 1155345 and bug 720525) as well as errors that happen during
    file copying (bug 662442).
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/argv
  - Fix use of argv when calling os.execve
* Merged in lp:~verb/duplicity/bucket_root_fix
  - Fix bug that prevents backing up to the root of a bucket with boto backend.
* Merged in lp:~gliptak/duplicity/415619
  - Better error message when chown fails
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/log-path-type
  - Any backup browser built on top of duplicity will need to indicate which
    files in the backup are folders and which are files. The current logging
    information doesn't provide this detail. So I've added a field to the
    log.InfoCode.file_list output that includes the path type.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/manifest-oddities
  - We may accidentally end up with an oddly inconsistent manifest like so:
    Volume 1
    Volume 2
    Volume 3
    Volume 2
    As did get reported recently on the mailing list:
    http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2013-11/msg00009.html
  - One way this can happen (the only way?) is if you back up, then duplicity
    gets interrupted between writing the manifest and uploading the volume.
    Then, when restarted, there is no longer enough data to create as many
    volumes as existed previously.
  - This situation can cause an exception when trying to restart the backup.
  - This branch fixes it by deleting any excess volume information encountered
    when loading in the manifest. We discard volume with higher numbers
    than the last one read.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/disappearing-source
  - When restarting a backup, we may accidentally skip the first chunk of one of
    the source files. To reproduce this,:
    1) interrupt a backup
    2) delete the source file it was in the middle of
    3) restart the backup
  - When replaying the source iterator to find where to resume from, we can't
    notice that the file is gone until we've already iterated past where it
    would be!
  - The solution I came up with is to just let duplicity stuff the data we
    accidentally read back into the source iterator.
  - This is actually a data loss bug, because it's possible to back up
    corrupted files (that are missing their first chunk).
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/normalize-before-using
  - Avoid throwing an exception due to a None element in a patch sequence.
  - None elements in a (non-normalized) patch sequence are perfectly normal.
    With the current code in the patched function, it is certainly possible to
    hit a crash due a None.
    See http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2013-11/msg00005.html
  - This branch fixes that by normalizing the sequence before using it in the
    logging code. It's acceptable to bring the normalize_ps() call outside the
    try/except block because normalize_ps is not expected to throw. It's
    relatively simple and doesn't really use its objects besides checking if
    they are None.
* Applied patch to fix "Access GDrive through gdocs backend failing"
  - see https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2013-07/msg00007.html
* Merged in lp:~jkrauss/duplicity/pyrax
  - Rackspace has deprecated python-cloudfiles in favor of their pyrax
    library, which consolidates all Rackspace Cloud API functionality into
    a single library.  Tested it with Duplicity 0.6.21 on both Arch Linux
    and FreeBSD 8.3.0.
* Changed to default to pyrax backend rather than cloudfiles backend.
  To revert to the cloudfiles backend use '--cf-backend=cloudfiles'
* Merged in lp:~verb/duplicity/boto-min-version
  - Update documentation and error messages to match the current actual version
    requirements of boto backend.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/debian.paramiko.log
  - upstream debian patch "paramiko logging"
    http://patch-tracker.debian.org/package/duplicity/0.6.22-2
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/debian.dav.mkdir
  - upstream debian patch "webdav create folder recursively"
    http://patch-tracker.debian.org/package/duplicity/0.6.22-2
* Nuke tabs
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/encoding
  - This branch hopefully fixes two filename encoding issues:
  - Users in bug 989496 were noticing a UnicodeEncodeError exception which
    happens (as far as I can tell) because some backends (like webdav) are
    returning unicode filenames from list(). When these filenames are combined
    with the utf8 translations of log messages, either (A) the default ascii
    encoding can't handle promoting the utf8 bytes or -- if there aren't any
    utf8 bytes in the translation -- (B) the resulting unicode string raises
    an error later when log.py tries to upgrade the string again to unicode
    for printing.
  - This fix is largely implemented by adding a wrapper for backend list()
    implementations. This wrapper ensures that duplicity internals always see
    a byte string. (I'd like to eventually use this same wrapping strategy to
    implement generic retry support without backends having to add any logic,
    but that's just a thought for the future.)
  - That is, the fix for issue #1 is completely inside backend.py and the
    changes to backends/*.py.
  - The rest of the invasive changes deal with filenames that may not be valid
    utf8. This is much rarer, but possible. For proper handling of this, we
    need to print using unicode, and convert filenames from the system filename
    encoding to unicode, gracefully handling conversion errors. Some of the
    filenames we print are remote names. Who knows what encoding they are in;
    it could be different than the system filename encoding. 99% of the time,
    everything will be utf8 and we're fine. If we do get conversion errors,
    the only effect should be some question mark characters in duplicity
    logging output.
  - I tried to convert as much of the actual codebase to use unicode for
    printing. But I stopped short of adding an assert in log.py to enforce
    unicode, because I didn't want to go through all the backend code and
    manually adjust those bits without being able to test each one.
* Restored missing line from patch of gdocsbackend.py
* Reverted changes to gdocsbackend.py
* Restored patch of gdocsbackend.py from original author (thanks ede)
* Applied patch from bug 1266753: Boto backend removes local cache if
  connection cannot be made
* Merged in lp:~louis-bouchard/duplicity/add-allow-concurrency
  - Implement locking mechanism to avoid concurrent execution under the same
    cache directory. This is the default behavior.
  - Also implement --alllow-concurrency option to disable the locking
    if required.
  - This functionality adds a dependency to python-lockfile


New in v0.6.22 (2013/08/22)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Applied patches from Laszlo Ersek to rdiffdir to "consume a chain of sigtar
  files in rdiffdir delta mode" which supports incremental sigtar files.
* Merged in lp:~jnoster/duplicity/dpbx-added
  - Add Dropbox backend
  - NB! In order to use the backend one must:
    1. Install Dropbox Python SDK first.
    2. Run the duplicity with Dropbox backend (dpbx://) first time
       *interactively* to catch and follow the oAuth URL.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/verify.data
  - add switch --compare-data, to selectively enable formerly always disabled
    data comparison on verify runs
* Merged in lp:~tblue/duplicity/paramiko-1.10.0
  - This fixes bug #1156746, making the Paramiko backend compatible with
    Paramiko 1.10.0. It keeps compatibility with older Paramiko versions.
* Merged in lp:~townsend/duplicity/fix-1161599-2
  - The fix in revno. 912 didn't take into account that the parameter "body"
    passed into request() is overloaded, so when it was NULL or of a type other
    than file, it would fail.  This checks if "body" is of type "file" before
    actually seek()'ing back to the beginning of the file.
* Merged in lp:~tblue/duplicity/paramiko-fix-delete-retry
  - This fixes bug #1115715, which is really annoying. Basically it makes
    using the Paramiko backend with the default settings impossible.
* Merged in lp:~juan-f/duplicity/progress
  - From time ago, there are people asking for a progress bar estimation in duplicity.
    There is even a script that circumvents the issue, getting info from the log so as
    to estimate the progress status ( https://github.com/quentin/Duplicity-progress )
    but does not give enough feedback and the estimation is rather plain.
  - I have developed a set of heuristics that gather information from the deltas and
    the transfer ratios of the backend so as to forecast % of progress, estimation of
    remaining time and average speed, for both full and incremental backup uploads.
  - The current implementation works for boto backend, but to port the other backends
    to use this feature would be quite easy (we can discuss the details if interested).
  - The algorithm is activated by the --progress command line flag, and will perform a
    first-pass dry-run to collect evidence for all the deltas. Next it will trigger the
    real upload, while a thread statistically estimates the ratio of changes and
    compression for the data in/out, and uses these ratios to forecast time remaining
    and % of completion.
  - The progress data will be logged each 3 seconds, or the --progress-rate flag.

New in v0.6.21 (2013/01/23)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/24syntaxfix
  - fix python 2.4 vs 2.5 syntax error
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/u1-oauthlib
  - As the Ubuntu packager for duplicity, I would prefer u1backend.py
    used oauthlib instead of oauth.  oauthlib is well maintained upstream
    (unlike oauth), has a python3 port (for the future), and is in Ubuntu
    main (so is oauth right now, but hopefully in the future we can drop
    it to universe, in which case duplicity can't use it anymore).
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/delete-new-sig-in-cache
  - In duplicity 0.6.20, we fixed bug 1031269. This means that we no longer
    leave sig files on the remote location.  Leaving sig files on the remote
    location also caused a bug with deleting cache files. Code used to leave
    remote new-sig but delete the locale cache new-sig; this meant that we would
    keep downloadoing the new-sig all the time from remote. We had worked around
    that by just not deleting the new-sig in the cache, which was sort of the
    wrong side of that problem to tackle.  Now that we handle the remote
    new-sigs better (by deleting them), I don't think we need this code anymore.
    Patch by az@debian.org.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/u1-ascii-error
  - Fix for u1backend unicode error.  Patch by Paul Barker.
* Merged in lp:~satwell/duplicity/caching
  - Add a cache for password and group lookups. This significantly improves
    runtime with very large password and group configurations.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/manpage
  - more formatting fixes, clarifications in sections EXAMPLES, FILE SELECTION
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/lftp.netrc
  - Allow .netrc auth for lftp backend
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/946988
  - This fixes bug 946988 by not duplicating the checks for when we should ask
    for the password (those same checks are done more correctly inside
    get_passphrase). And add a test to reproduce the bug.
* Merged in lp:~lenharo-h/duplicity/duplicity
  - Generate encrypted backups without revealing the user's key id
    via option --hidden-encrypt-key
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/u1-utf8

* Merged in lp:~carlos-abalde/duplicity/gdocs-backend-gdata-2.0.16.-upgrade
  - Upgrade of GoogleDocs backend to python gdata lib >= 2.0.15:
    Stop using get_everything method.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav.fix-retry
  - bugfix: webdav retrying broke on ERRORS like "error: [Errno 32] Broken pipe" in
    socket.pyas reported here https://answers.launchpad.net/duplicity/+question/212966
    added a more generalized 'retry_fatal' decorator which makes retrying backend
    methods even easier
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/manpage
  - Clear up PASSPHRASE reusage as sign passphrase.  Minor fixes.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/u1_and_manpage
  - Manpage
    - document Ubuntu One required python libs
    - added continuous contributors and backend author notes
  - U1backend
    - lazily import non standard python libs, fixes
    http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.sysutils.backup.duplicity.general/5753
    - fix "not bytearray" prevents PUT with python 2.6
    - don't hang after putting in credentials (cause it silently retries in background)
      but go through with backup
* Fixed 1091269 Data corruption when resuming with --no-encryption
  - Patches from Pascual Abellan that make block size consistent and
    that add -n (no-encryption) option to manual-ctrl-c-test.sh.
  - Modified gpg.py patch to use 64k block size so unit test passes.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/static-corruption
  - This branch fixes three possible ways a backup could get data-corrupted.
    Inspired by bug 1091269.
      A) If resuming after a volume that ended in a one-block file, we would
         skip the first block of the next file.
      B) If resuming after a volume that ended in a multi-block file, we would
         skip the first block of the next file.
      C) If resuming after a volume that spanned a multi-block file, we would
         skip some data inside the file.
  - A and B are because when finding the right place in the source files to
    restart the backup, the iteration loop didn't handle None block numbers
    very well (which are used to indicate the end of a file).
  - C is what bug 1091269 talks about. This was because data block sizes would
    get smaller as the difftar file got closer and closer to the volsize.
    Standard block sizes were 64 * 1024.  But say we were close to the end of
    the difftar... When resuming, duplicity doesn't know the custom block sizes
    used by the previous run, so it uses standard block sizes. And it doesn't
    always match up, as you can imagine. So we would leave chunks of data out
    of the backed up file.
  - Tests added for these cases.
  - This branch is called 'static-corruption' because all these issues occur
    even when the source data doesn't change. I still think there are some
    corruption issues when a file changes in between duplicity runs. I haven't
    started looking into that yet, but that's next on my list.
  - C only happened without encryption (because the gpg writer function already
    happened to force a constant data block size). A and B happened with or
    without encryption.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav.fix-retry
  - added ssl certificate verification (see man page)
  - more robust retry routine to survive ssl errors, broken pipe errors
  - added http redirect support
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav.manpage
  - explanation of webdav changes above
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/pygi
  - Python bindings for the gobject stack (used in the gio backend) have changed
    from static to dynamically-generated bindings. The old static bindings are
    deprecated. So here's a branch to change the gio backend from old to new ones.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py3rsync
  - This branch lets one build the _librsync module with Python 3. You can't
    really do anything useful with it, but it's a nicely-isolated piece to add
    Python 3 support for.
  - The changes are a mix of modernization and #ifdef logic.
  - All tests still pass in Python 2.7 and 2.4. I tested manually that the module
    worked as expected in Python 3.
* Merged in lp:~duplicity-team/duplicity/po-updates
  - Updated translations


New in v0.6.20 (2012/10/28)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/ssh.manpage
  - added gdocs and rsync REQUIREMENTS
  - added cloudfiles documentation
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/gpginterface
  - refactor GnuPGInterface to gpginterface.py
    reasoning can be found in README
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/duplicity.helpfix
  - fix rare 'TypeError: encode() argument 1 must be string, not None'
  - http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2012-09/msg00016.html
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/duplicity.tmpspacefix
  - use tempfile.TemporaryFile() so unused temp files are deleted automagically
  - propbably solve bug 'Out of space error while restoring a file'
  - https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1005901
  - http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2012-09/msg00000.html
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/utf8-po
  - For some crazy reason, the gettext module defaults to giving you strings in
    whatever charset the po file happened to define.  Which means you never know
    what string of bytes you're going to get.  This module makes sure we always
    get utf-8 byte strings.  So we're at least predictable and reduces one
    source of UnicodeDecodeErrors (like in bug 989496)
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/1031277
  - ssh: actually delete all the requested files, not just the first one
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/leftover-sigtar
  - So currently, duplicity does not delete signature files when doing a
    remove-all-but-n operation. Seems wrong, since those signature files are now
    useless and take up space.
  - This branch does several things:
    1) Make remove-all-but-n operate on chains. In practice it did before, since
       the sets it operated on always came from complete chains (i.e. it never
       used only some of the sets from a chain)
    2) Add a new method to get all signature chains before a certain time.
    3) Use this new method to also delete signature chains during remove-all-but
       operations.
  - And it cleans up the cleanuptest.py file:
    1) Removes crufty, unused code
    2) Disallows changing the destination folder for the test, which no one
       would ever want to do and isn't really supported anyway
    3) Add some additional checks to the existing test
    4) Adds two new methods to test remove-all-but-n and
       remove-all-inc-of-but-n-full
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/duplicity.manpage
  - disabled hyphenation and block justification for better readablility of
    command line examples.
  - reformatted REQUIREMENTS section for hopefully better online rendering
  - minor clarifications
* Merged in lp:~gregretkowski/duplicity/cf-retry-delete
  - This will retry cloudfile delete commands. With large numbers of archive
    files over mediocre links transient network errors will occasionally cause
    deletes to fail and these should be retried.
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/ropath.index
  - This branch does two main things:
    1) Skips base dir entries when compiling the list of deleted delta iters.
       (this gracefully recovers from the sort of situations that lead to bug
       929067). I'm reasonably confident this is an uninvasive change, but
       please confirm.
    2) Overwrites the sigtar file on backup-restart. This is because AFAICT,
       duplicity will rewrite the entire sigtar each restart. But we were
       opening the sigtar file as "ab", so we'd just dump the contents on top
       of the previous contents. Which was causing some confusion in bug 929067.
       If I'm wrong that we don't always rewrite the entire sigtar each time,
       this needs some rethink. Please also confirm that.
  - In addition, I added two tests for the above two changes and make some
    improvements elsewhere in the restarttest.py file while I was at it.
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/ssh-pexpect-msgbug
  - Fixes 'UnboundLocalError: local variable 'msg' referenced before assignment'
    in _ssh_pexpect.py
* Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/gpg.tmp
  - place gpg.py tempfiles in duplicity's tmp subfolder which is cleaned
    whatever happens
* Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/u1-402
  - Switch the code we check for out-of-space in u1backend.
* Applied patch for #1066625 ubuntu one backend
  - add delay between retries

New in v0.6.19 (2012/05/22)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* lots of work on the man page to clean up requirements, etc.
* use empty listbody for enhanced webdav compatibility
* initial folder creation on backend does not result in a ResponseNotReady
  anymore
* add ssh_config support (/etc/ssh/ssh_config + ~/.ssh/config) to paramiko
  sshbackend
* add missing_host_key prompt to new sshbackend similar to ssh procedure
* added --ssh-backend parameter to switch between paramiko,pexpect

  previously just aborted.
* a couple more warning error codes that Deja Dup is interested in noticing.
* ssh paramiko backend respects --num-retries now
* set retry delay for ssh backends to 10s

New in v0.6.18 (2012/02/29)
---------------------------
Enhancements:
* fix extraneous '.py' in botobackend.py include
* tests: add delay between backups to avoid assertion error
* tests: use backup source that is more likely to be larger than 1M compressed
* tests: make other-filesystem check more robust against certain directories
  being mounts or not

  encryption settings do not match original settings' error because curtime is
  incorrectly set away from previous incremental value
* added option to not compress the backup, when no encryption is selected
* always delay a little bit when a backend gives us errors
* Don't cache TarInfo files. Tests still pass, so I don't believe we need the
  members cache (and in the old tarfile.py, we didn't cache either).
* Adding --file-prefix option so different sets of backups can be stored in the
  same bucket.  See blueprint at
  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/duplicity/+spec/file-prefix-option
* two changes that help the test suite pass
* raise log level on backend import failure so it will be visible under default
  conditions
* file /etc/motd may not exist in test environment.  Use __file__ instead to
  point to a known plaintext source file.
* some code/import changes to make the ssh and boto backends compatible with
  Python 2.4.
* some changes to make roottest.py compatible with the new dir structure.

---------------------------
Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/list-old-chains
List/keep old signature chains

Applied patches from Kasper Brand that fixed device file handling.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2009-09/msg00001.html

Merged in lp:~l2g/duplicity/flag-transl-comments which cleared up how
translation comments should be passed to the translators cleanly now.

Applied 422477; [PATCH] IMAP Backend Error in delete()

Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/iterate-warnings

Fix problems with unittests under Jaunty.  It appears that redirection
in os.system() has changed for the worse, so a workaround for now.

Fix problem in restart where there were no manifest entries and no
remote volumes stored.  We clean out the partial and restart.

Fixed 435975 gpg asks for password in 0.6.05, but not in 0.5.18


New in v0.6.05 (2009/08/28)
---------------------------
Merged in lp:~l2g/duplicity/test-compat from Larry Gilbert which made
the testing compatible across more systems.  Also fixed the remaining
collectionstest bug which was trying to test with no cache present.

Bugs fixed this release:
407968  GIO backend can't restore
408059  Failure due to _logger.log failure for content with special
        characters: TypeError decoding Unicode not supported
409593  deja-dup (or duplicity) deletes all signatures
412667  "duplicity remove-older-than" asks for passphrase even though
        not required
418170  [PATCH] file names longer then 512 symbols are not supported


New in v0.6.04 (2009/08/01)
---------------------------
One major and one minor change.  The "No such file or directory" error
is bad enough that this should be released quickly.  For those of you
using encryption, this is not a problem, but for those of you that do
not use encryption (--no-encryption), then this will manifest itself if
the local cache gets out of sync with the remote store.

Bugs fixed this release:
405734  duplicity fails to restore files that contain a newline character
403790  Backup error: No such file or directory


New in v0.6.03 (2009/07/29)
---------------------------
Lots of small changes and some bug fixes.
* Restart error handling has been smoothed out a great deal and it
  "does what is right" in order to keep going.
* Backends are now optional, if they fail an Info message is put out
  to notify of the failure and why.
* There was more work on translations and internationalization.
Thanks to everyone!

Bugs fixed this release:
377528  --file-to-restore doesn't work with trailing slash
394757  Backend imports should be made optional
398230  Deja-dup backup fails with message: "Unable to locate last file"

402794  duplicity public-key-only incompatible with gnupg 2.0.11


New in v0.6.02 (2009/07/07)
---------------------------
Duplicity will now remove any spurious files left in the cache from
a previous run.  This will keep the metadata cache in sync with the
remote storage metadata.

Bugs fixed this release:
394629  Hang on first collection-status
379386  Fix 'list-current-files' with missing archive dir
395826  "No such file or directory" when backing up second time
394627  User-friendly archive dir print
388699  Manifest mismatch error


New in v0.6.01 (2009/07/01)
---------------------------
Fixed issues in Checkpoint/Restart:
* The --name backupname" option was added to allow the
  user to separate one archive from another.  If not
  specified, the default is an MD5 hash of the target
  URL, which should suffice for most uses.

* The archive_dir (cache) is now stored in a standard
  location, defaulting to ~/.cache/duplicity.  See
  http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/

* The interaction between the --archive-dir option and
  the --name option allows for four possible results
  for the location of the archive dir.
    - neither specified (default)
      ~/.cache/duplicity/hash-of-url
    - --archive-dir=~/arch, no --name
      ~/arch/hash-of-url
    - no --archive-dir, --name=foo
      ~/.cache/duplicity/foo
    - --archive-dir=~/arch, --name=foo
      ~/arch/foo

* duplicity will now copy needed metadata from the
  remote store to the local cache as needed.  This
  means that the first use after upgraded from 0.5.x
  will have the metadata copied to the local archive
  dir in order to sync both.

* cleanup will now work correctly with the archive
  dir and separates the local from the remote files.

Bugs fixed this release:
* 388034     Unable to backup
* 378940     python2-6 issue / UTF-8 charset / Ubuntu 9.04

New in v0.6.00 (2009/06/08)
---------------------------
Checkpoint/Restart capability added.  Checkpoint is
done at every volume written and Restart is done at
start of the next volume in the set.  Changes to
normal operations include a permanent duplicity
archive-dir at ~/.duplicity to save state.

To accomplish this, the signature and archive files
in the archive-dir now have three states:
1) temporary until the first volume has been written,
2) partial until the final volume has been written and
   sent to remote storage,
3) permanent with the same name as always.

Assumptions are made that if a restart is needed, then
all arguments are the same as before and that no files
have been removed from the file system between runs.

From now on, the --archive-dir option can be used to
change the location of the archive dir, but you are
responsible for moving the files if you change it.

Other fixes:
Unicode filenames in log messages are now OK.

Fixed problem where Cygwin was returning -1 for the
hard max open file limit.


New in v0.5.18 (2009/05/20)
---------------------------
Added support for RackSpace's CloudFiles, cf+http.

Added support for Tahoe-LAFS from the patch,
patch #6743: Tahoe backend for duplicity
https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6743

Only half of this bug is fixed but it's still useful.
bug #21792: pipe call fails with an error OSError:
            [Errno 24] Too many open files
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?21792

Changed from using ulimit external command to
resource.getrlimit to check open files limit.


New in v0.5.17 (2009/05/04)
---------------------------
Removed one line of code left from some testing that I
did that caused a crash when the target dir was empty
and collection-status was requested.

Moved from using the df command to get temp space
availability to Python's os.statvfs() call.  Not all
df commands work the same way.

patch #6813: Making changelist easy to read

---------------------------
bug #24825: duplicity warn on insufficient TMPDIR
            space availability and low max open
            file limits pre-backup.
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?24825

patch #6806: More graceful handling of old
             --short-filename files
https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6806

Added tilde and variable expansion to the source or
target argument that is not a URL.


New in v0.5.15 (2009/04/09)
---------------------------
FTP backend was failing on PureFTPd when the "-x ''"
option was removed from the second ncftpls popen, a fix
that was implemented due to bug #24741.  This fix does
the ls in one pass by extracting the last entry on the
'ls -l' listing.

If a file is unreadable due to access rights or other
non-fatal errors, put out error message and continue
rather than dying messily with a traceback.

Added tilde '~' expansion and variable expansion in the
options that require a filename.  You can now have this
"--archive-dir=~/ArchDir/$SYSNAME" if you need it.  No
expansion is applied to the source or target URL's.

Fixed problem I caused, again, where sys.exit() was
trapping instead of exiting.  Added big note to not
to do that again.


New in v0.5.14 (2009/04/02)
---------------------------
After email voting among known duplicity contributors,
the decision was reached to revert to the GPL Version 2
license, so with their consensus, duplicity is now under
GPL Version 2.

Revert to calling NcFTP utilities (ls, get, put) directly
rather than scripting ncftp via pexpect by reverting to the
0.5.07 version of ftpbackend.py.

Changed fatal error regarding version 3.2.0 of ncftpput to
warning level since it has been reported that the problem
does not occur on most distributions.

Changed from log.Log with numbered log levels to log.Debug,
log.Info, log.Notice, log.Warn, log.FatalError as below:
    0    log.FatalError
    1-2  log.Warn
    3-4  log.Notice
    5-8  log.Info
    9 log.Debug
The -vN option has not changed.  Verbosity may also be one
of: character [ewnid], or word ['error', 'warning', 'notice',
'info', 'debug'].  The default is 4 (Notice).  The options
-v4, -vn, and -vnotice are functionally equivalent, as are
the mixed-case versions, -vN, -vNotice, -vNOTICE.

Normalized include statements and tried to insure that all
duplicity includes were from the duplicity module.

patch #6790: Add --exclude-if-present
https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6790


New in v0.5.13 (2009/03/26)
---------------------------
Add more error detection to FTP backend.

Fix backends so sleep does not occur after last retry.

Fix so BackendException does not cause traceback except when
verbosity is at level 5 or higher (Info level).

Adjust log levels so some errors show up with default verbosity.

Fixed bug where an extra comma caused a traceback during a warning
about unnecessary sig files.  Plus fixed print so the real filename
would show up and not a Python object representation.

Add Changelog.GNU to website and distribution to add a bit of detail
showing the CVS changes via rcs2log.  Added dist/mkGNUChangelog.sh.

bug #22908: Don't block gpg-agent
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?22908

To fix the above, --use-agent was added as a command line option.
When this is specified and asymetric encryption is enabled, then all
GnuPG passphrases will come from the gpg-agent or equivalent program
and no passphrase prompt will be issued.

bug #25787: Usernames with escaped @-sign are not handled properly
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?25787

bug #25976: Password requested when not needed.
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?25976

patch #6787: import duplicity.GnuPGInterface explicitly
https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6787


New in v0.5.12 (2009/03/15)
---------------------------
bug #25838: Backup fails / ncftp - remote file already exists
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?25838
With this fix we also get resume in ftp get/put.  If a put or
get fails part of the way through, ncftp will resume on the
next retry.

bug #25853: duplicity fails with boto passwords coming from ~/.boto
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?25853

patch #6773: Make user name optional in rsync backend
https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6773

GPG errors will no longer cause tracebacks, but will produce a
log entry, from gpg, similar to the following:
===== Begin GnuPG log =====
gpg: BAD0BAD0: skipped: public key not found
gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: public key not found
===== End GnuPG log =====
This will let the user know what really caused the GPG process
to fail, and what really caused errors like 'broken pipe'.

Add Epydoc output to web site and start adding documentation.

https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6762


New in v0.5.10 (2009/03/01)
---------------------------
The default filename format has changed from W3 style to a long
numeric style, YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ, with no delimiters, thus is now
compatible with Windows/Samba filesystems.  The time is UTC, not
local, so there will be no timezone or daylight savings time issues.

Duplicity still recognizes the old long filename format, and will
continue incremental backup chains if found.  The old format is
still available via the --old-filenames option (pending deprecation).

Users of --short-filenames or --time-separator should stop using these
options on their next full backup.  The new filenames are compatible
with your system.

The following options are pending deprecation and will be removed in a
future release:
    --time-separator
    --short-filenames
    --old-filenames

New in v0.5.09 (2009/02/17)
---------------------------
FTP is now driven with pexpect rather than NcFTP utilities.
This closes the following bugs (and solves other problems):
bug #24741: ncftpls -x '' causes failure on Yahoo FTP server
bug #23516: duplicity/ncftpget not closing unlinked files, ...

New in v0.5.08 (2009/02/02)
---------------------------

https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6730

patch #6733: Improve error handling in imapbackend.py
https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6733

Increase default volume size (--volsize) to 25M from 5M.  This
reduces the number of volumes to accomodate larger backups.

Reworked patch 6701 to list collection one at a time rather than
writing all as one huge list.  Was causing memeory problems when
the collections got large.

Fix backendtest.py so that empty URL's in config.py cause the
backend test to be skipped rather than erroring.  Added notes
in config.py.tmpl explaining the change.

Add/update copyright statements in all distribution source files
and revert duplicity to GPL version 2 license.

Original fix to disallow use of ncftpput 3.2.0 mistyped the ErrorCode
used and resulted in an error rather than an explanation.


New in v0.5.06 (2009/01/09)
---------------------------
Fix to deprecation warnings about sha and md5 modules.
Uses hashlib if available, otherwise original module.

Added loop to run-all-tests.sh to run all tests against all supported
versions of Python if available.  Looks for 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6.

Noah Spurrier has given us permission to distribute pexpect.py along
with duplicity, so this will no longer be an install requirement.

NcFTP version 3.2.0 will not work with duplicity since we require the
use of both -f and -C options on ncftpput.  3.1.9, 3.2.1+ work fine.
I put in error checks for this situation in the FTP backend code.

Dan Muresan created a patch to minimize the number of password
prompts.  To do so, it sometimes requests a password once without
confirmation; if later it turns out that a full backup is needed,
the user is prompted for confirmation.

patch #6453: handle absolute urls in webdav backend
https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6453

Fix problem where S3 prefix was prepended with 'd'.  This caused
a failure in the regression tests.


New in v0.4.9 (2008/01/04)
--------------------------
NOTE: URL format correction in rsync://.  The rsync backend
now properly supports absolute and relative pathnames and
module access.  The formats are:
    rsync://user@host::/module/some_dir
    rsync://user@host/relative_path
    rsync://user@host//absolute_path

Fixed regression caused by changeover to new urlparse.py.
bug #21475: FTP Usernames that contain '@' are not recognized
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?21475

Added section URL FORMAT in the duplicity man page.

Added 2nd patch to bug #21475 that forces all versions of
Python to use the fixed urlparse.py.

Fixed so that remove-older-than and remove-all-but-n-full
will not request a GPG passphrase.

Fixed issue with Pure-FTPd that would always return an empty
directory listing and thus force a full backup every time.
A side effect of the change is that we now only make one call
to ncftpls to get the listing, thereby reducing the overhead
on systems with a large number of backup files.

New in v0.4.8 (2007/12/15)
--------------------------
First pass at bringing unittest cases up to date.
All unit tests are working, but more test cases need
to be added to handle the new protocols, plus there is
some print leakage even with logging turned off.

Allow pexpect to force the close of the child on sftp
calls.  We already do that with scp calls.  This cleans
up that exception.

New in v0.4.5 (2007/11/26)
--------------------------
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?21646
Fix to handling of collections when --archive-dir is used.
Prior to this, duplicity would write the full sig files to
both local and remote, then delete the remote.  Now, it does
not delete the remote full sigs.

Applied the following patches from Peter Schuller
patch #6279, add command 'remove-all-but-n-full'
patch #6280, clarify --archive-dir option
patch #6281, --help should print to stdout, not stderr
patch #6282, collection-status: output in more consistent order


New in v0.4.4 (2007/11/23)
--------------------------
All the changes in RC1 through RC4 plus:

Changes to ftpBackend to use a temp login config file rather
than putting the username and password on the command line.
This requires the use of NcFTP 3.1.9 or later.

Thanks to a patch from Greg Hewgill the Amazon S3 backend now
uses --num-retries to retry IO repeatedly if needed.

Changes to commandline processing to allow non-ambiguous short
strings for commands, i.e. 'i', 'inc', 'incr' for 'incremental',
'f' for 'full', etc..  A warning message is printed if the short
command is not unique.  Note: this already works for options, so
I just applied the same idea to commands.

Applied a patch from Gregory Hartman to correct handling of DST
in time calculations.  This affects backups made the night of
a DST time switch.


New in v0.4.4.RC4 (2007/10/26)
------------------------------
WARNING:  COMMAND LINE CHANGES ARE NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE!
There is a new command line syntax to separate actions and
options.  Refer to the new man page for full details of the
change.  The new syntax looks like:
    duplicity [full|incr] [options] source_dir target_url
    duplicity [restore] [options] source_url target_dir
    duplicity verify [options] source_url target_dir
    duplicity collection-status [options] target_url
    duplicity list-current-files [options] target_url
    duplicity cleanup [options] target_url
    duplicity remove-older-than time [options] target_url

Fixed issue in --time-separator where the current time string
was being set prior to setting the separator, causing errors
when trying to set the --time-separator for Windows systems.

Fix so that file mtime is always compared in full seconds.

Fix so that ftpBackend.delete() does not print file list.


New in v0.4.4.RC3 (2007/10/02)
------------------------------
Patch from Olivier Croquette to add --full-if-older-than=<time>
option to force a full backup at <time> rather than incremental.

Patch from Stefan Hoth to add :port option in FTP.

Patch from Mitchell Garnaat to get all keys from S3, rather
than just the first 1000.

Fix to sshBackend to version check for python-pexpect 2.1.

Fix one case in ftpBackend where host string was used instead of
url_string.  This only affected the creation of the target dir on
the remote system, if it did not exist, and only if the user or
port needed to be specified.


New in v0.4.4.RC2 (2007/09/26)
------------------------------
Added --timeout <seconds> (default 30) to allow users to change
duplicity's network timeout settings.

Added --time-separator <char> to allow users to change the time
separator from ':' to another character that will work on their
system.  HINT: For Windows SMB shares, use --time-separator='_'.
NOTE: '-' is not valid as it conflicts with date separator.

Add patch from Alexander Zangerl to suppress the GPG passphrase
prompt when a passphrase is not needed.
 - full and pubkey enc:  doesn't depend on old encrypted info
 - inc and pubkey enc and archive-dir: need manifest and sigs,
   which the archive dir contains unencrypted
 - with encryption disabled
 - listing files:  needs manifest, but the archive dir has that
 - collection status:  only looks at a repository

Add patch from Olivier Croquette to allow user@domain usernames,
making ftp://user@domain@domain.com/path a valid URL.

Added a bit of debug print to sshBackend for --verbosity=9.

Changed usage message to separate options and commands.


New in v0.4.4.RC1 (2007/09/19)
------------------------------
Patches applied from Debian
DP: fix #228388: old/aborted/offending sig files prohibit further action
DP: fixes manual page and usage msg for rsync url and --remove-older-than
DP: make tempfiles with useful names
DP: do not ask for a passphrase if none is required!

https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?21123
duplicity 0.4.3 ftpBackend did not find backup sets when there was
more than 20 files in directory.

https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6212
Large performance boost for large volume sizes.

https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6211
Restore strict host checking in sshBackend.

https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6205
Add option --librsync-dir for when its not found.


New in v0.4.3 (2007/08/20)
--------------------------
All the changes in RC1 through RC12 plus:

Move get_password() to Backend class to standardize.

Fix problem with ftpBackend to create target directory
if needed.  Note: this creates only one level.

Dropped ssh-command and added ssh-options to allow users
to add options to the scp and sftp commmands.

Removed use of tempfile.TemporaryFile().  This fixes the
restore problem on Windows that was due to Python bug
1776696 reported on Sourceforge.

Fixed Debian Bug#437694: Make bzip2 compression optional.
The default is not to do bzip2 compression.  To use bzip2
add the following command line option:
--gpg-options='--compress-algo=bzip2 --bzip2-compress-level=9'
Note: do not add spaces in the string value.

Fixed bug 20764 - unable to use port in ssh backend.
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?20764

Remove ssh_command option, add ssh_options.  This adds
options to the scp and sftp commands that are used by
the ssh backend.

Change ssh backend to send 'quit' instead of EOF when
using sftp.  This allows it to run under cron as long
as the password is supplied non-interactively.

Change ssh backend to not pass :port part of URL to
scp or sftp.  We already supply -oPort=xx for port.


New in v0.4.3.RC12 (2007/08/09)
-------------------------------
Fix index out of range in Bug 20730, triggered when there
is only one incremental in the list.
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?20730

Changed the file:, ftp:, and ssh: backends so that
the target directory will be created at start.

Changed the ftp: backend so that empty target dirs
do not error out.


New in v0.4.3.RC11 (2007/07/20)
-------------------------------
Duplicity is now covered under GPL version 3 (or later).

Duplicity now correctly processes scp URL's of the form:
  scp://user@host[:port]/
where the directory spec is empty.  This fixes a bug where the
user could not write into the home directory on the target.

The SSH/SCP backend has had an overhaul.  It now requires the
python-pexpect module.  Normally this can be obtained from your
distro's repository, but if you want, you can download pexpect
from http://pexpect.sourceforge.net.

The SSH/SCP backend work was done to allow the user to use password
authentication rather than public-key.  You may now enter a password,
either through the FTP_PASSWORD environment variable, or at the
console.  To activate this feature you will need to use the option
--ssh-askpass on the command line.  The default is public-key, which
does *not* look for a password from either source.

Various fixes to the man page for --ssh-askpass, --remove-older-than,
and --archive-dir.


New in v0.4.3.RC10 (2007/07/14)
-------------------------------
Add support for:
  --ftp-passive,
  --ftp-regular

Removed -m option on FTP put command.  This means that the remote
directory must exist prior to backup.

Changed ftpBackend from -f option back to commandline.  Various
versions of ncftp* interact differently when both -f and commandline
options are supplied.

The FTP password is munged in all log operations.

Added logging of filenames in the bucket when -v9 is used on
Amazon S3.


New in v0.4.3.RC9 (2007/07/09)
------------------------------
Change to a max block size of 2048 bytes for rsync difference buffer.
This may slow things down for truly large files, but will give much
smaller deltas on files with numerous small changes, such as database
files.

New S3 backend, Boto, from Eric Evans, replaces bitBucket.  Boto can
be obtained from http://code.google.com/p/boto/.  I did not make this
a requirement for setup since its not in the normal repositories.

New FTP backend from Thorsten Schnebeck that uses ncftp instead of
Pythons ftplib.  This seems to be much more solid.  I added the -f
option with a secure temp file to contain host, user, and password,
rather than having them on the command line.  I also added the -m
option to the put command to create the target directory and the -t
option to make sure it times out if there is a network problem.

The Backend class now contains a popen_persist function that acts like
run_command_persist.  Both use the new num_retries global.

Added a commandline option, '--num-retries=<int>', to set the number
of retries.  The default is 5.


New in v0.4.3.RC8 (2007/06/27)
------------------------------
Bug 20282 - Thomas Tuttle:
An out of range index when checking past history in the backup
sets caused a failure when trying to access later.

Bug 20149 - dAniel hAhler:
dAniel submitted a second patch for this for further cleanup.
The new patch prefers the latest intact backup set.

Bug 20039 - Andreas Schildbach: --and--
Patch 6030 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
Duplicity now uses bzip2 for compression.  This matches the way
the Debian distribution handles it.  I'll think about adding an
option to override later, if its needed.


New in v0.4.3.RC7 (2007/06/19)
------------------------------
Bug 20179 - dAniel hAhler:
When errors cause login to fail in FTP, reset and try again.

Patch 6015 -dAniel hAhler:
Better display of traceback when ftpBackend errors out.

Patch 6029 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
http://bugs.debian.org/370206
archive-dir together with incremental backup results in crash. the
patch is simple, the code in 0.4.2 did attempt to access strings as
objects.

Patch 6031 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
http://bugs.debian.org/369971
there's some problems with unattended encrypted dumps, if the user
doesn't want to hand duplicity the gpg passphrase and attempts to work
around this by using a local archive dir.  the patch makes it look at
a manifest in a local archive dir if gpg doesn't manage to decrypt a
remote one (no surprise without a passphrase).

Patch 6032 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
a new feature patch: i've recently gotten annoyed with having
gazillions of 5mb files and therefore added a --volsize option to
allow the user setting the chunk size. the patch is simple and
contains a manpage update as well.

Patch 6033 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
let's add a --help terse usage message and don't just direct the user
to the manual. this should come handy if somebody needs to restore
stuff without having the manual available.


New in v0.4.3.RC6 (2007/06/13)
------------------------------
Bug 20149 - dAniel hAhler: When errors cause an incomplete backup set,
flag the error with a message, rather than erroring out.  The user
then knows to run --cleanup.

Patch 5998 - Kuang-che Wu: Cache uid and gid lookup to speed
operations.

Patch 5993 - daacyy302@sneakemail.com: Make Amazon S3 backend
incrementally more robust for recovery.


New in v0.4.3.RC5 (2007/06/04)
------------------------------
GnuPG fails when trying to access stdin on an empty passphrase.
Changes allow empty passphrase on public-key encryption and now
respond gracefully on empty passphrase for symmetric encryption.

dAniel hAhler submitted a patch to change "Error initializing file
foo" (log level 2), where foo was a socket, to "Skipping socket foo"
(log level 7).  https://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?5985

Change logging to flush after every write, unbuffering stdout and
stderr, thus producing logs that are coherent.


New in v0.4.3.RC4 (2007/06/02)
------------------------------
More fixes on FTP.  dAniel hAhler supplied a new patch for FTP that
cleans up the error handling and reduces the retry time to zero on the
first retry.


New in v0.4.3.RC3 (2007/05/31)
------------------------------
Fixed connection problem in FTP where it was not quitting on
connection reset and just logging in again.  This created many stale
logins on the remote system.

Changed attribution of a couple of patches to dAniel hAhler, who
actually wrote the patches, not just found them.


New in v0.4.3.RC2 (2007/05/30)
------------------------------
Fixed bug in tarfile.py that was causing ValueError exception.  Thanks
to dAniel hAhler for the patch that fixed the problem.  Refer to:

  https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?16711

ProFTPD resets the connection after returning 226 when NLSTing an
empty directory, so changed code to allow that exception.

ftpBackend now asks for a password if FTP_PASSWORD does not exist.

rsyncBackend was using full URL in the commandline and failing.
It now uses only server:path/, leaving off rsync://.

Added --sftp-command option, now that the scp backend uses sftp for
listing and deleting files.

Brian Sutherland has contributed a new backend for Amazon's S3 data
storage service.

Added some patches compiled by Andre Beckedorf:

    Tolerate more errors when listing an ftp directory (errors
    indicate an empty dir).

    Retry ftp commands when upon temporary error.  (Thanks to to
    Stefan Schimanski and dAniel hAhler for their patches.)


New in v0.4.2 (2006/02/02)
--------------------------
Mathias de Riese's substantial patch or patches appear to have been
applied to CVS years ago, but not released yet.  Sorry about that.

Followed suggestion by David Rigel, make user type passphrase twice to
confirm.

Eric Hanchrow's patch makes sure duplicity deletes older signatures
when using --remove-older-than.

Jiri Tyr's patch may fix some scp/sftp problems.

asdf's patch makes sure uids or gids over 2097151 don't corrupt the
tarfiles.

Cleaned up and documented --collection-status option, which lists the
backup chains and sets found in the repository.

FTP error 450 when listing a directory now understood to mean the
directory is empty (duplicity will not exit with error).

--remove-older-than now cannot delete the active backup chain, even if
you specify a time later than the chain (e.g. "--remove-older-than
now").


New in v0.4.1 (2003/08/09)
--------------------------
Applied (version of) Helmut Schneider's patch to display file mod
times with --list-current-files.

Fixed bug found by Rob Browning handling symlinks with long names that
have long names.

Applied Stephen Isard's patch to fix exclude-globbing-filelist.

Applied Sebastian Wilhelmi's patches to add rsync as a backend.

To improve large file performance, signature block size is now based
on file length.

duplicity should now build with librsync 0.9.6.  Much thanks to
Donovan Baarda for his work in this version of librsync.

duplicity should work with Python 2.3 now.


New in v0.4.0 (2002/11/30)
--------------------------
Changed restore procedure to download volumes from all backup sets
simultaneously.

Changed the verbosity level of some messages to 5, so level 4 is
cleaner.

Added --verify option, for checking whether a backup is up-to-date, or
to see what has changed since that backup.

GPG no longer needed: with --no-encryption option duplicity will write
gzipped volumes.  The checksums of volumes will still be verified, but
this will not stop a malicious attack because the manifest files can
be easily updated.

Earlier versions could crash when doing an incremental backup where no
files had changed.


New in v0.3.1 (2002/11/17)
--------------------------
Now by default the most recent files get restored, not the oldest.
You can get the old weird behavior by specifying --restore-time 1 (or
any other very early time).

Fixed a couple bugs where duplicity would crash if it found the remote
directory corrupted in various ways (for instance, if it contained a
file that looked like a duplicity file but had an invalid time
string).

Added --cleanup option, for deleting the files that may accumulate if
a duplicity session is aborted after it has uploaded some files.

Added --remove-older-than option, for safely deleting backup sets
older than the given time.

Suppress GPG log messages like "gpg: CAST5 encrypted data" if
verbosity is set to 3 or less.

short-filenames get even shorter---now use base 36 (0-9 and a-z) for
times and volume numbers.  This change is not backwards compatible but
probably I'm the only one affected.  If not, let me know and I can
probably write a little script.

Improved the way files are packed into the volumes so less space is
wasted per volume.

Decreased default volume size to 5MB (from 50MB) in preparation for
the new restore system planned for 0.4.0.


New in v0.3.0 (2002/11/10)
--------------------------
Added ftp backend.  Now the remote repository can accessed by ftp and
can be specified like "ftp://user@foo.bar/".

Added --ssh-command and --scp-command options, which can be used to
replace ssh and scp, or pass different arguments to them.  Requested
by Will Dyson.

Added --short-filenames option, for use when uploading to a file
system that can't have filenames longer than 30 characters (e.g. Mac
OS 8).

Added --list-current-files mode, which lists the files currently at
the given destination url.

Ported some statistics code from rdiff-backup.  Now by default
statistics are printed after a backup session.  This can be disabled
with the --no-print-statistics option.  Thanks to Mathieu Doidy for
requesting the above two features.

Added rdiff-backup-style --include/exclude-filelist-globbing options.
Now filelists with "+ /- " can be treated exactly like repeated
--include or --exclude options.

Fixed bug backing up normal files instead of directories.  Thanks to
Mathieu Doidy for bug report.


New in v0.2.1 (2002/10/31)
--------------------------
Security Fix:  Fixed bug where an rdiffdir patch containing a path
with a '..' component could overwrite files in parent directory.

Fixed bug where files without a username (only uid) would be marked as
changed every session.  Thanks to Peter Ehrenberg for bug report.

Now files with negative mtimes are treated as if they have mtime 0.
This prevents them from being marked as changed unnecessarily.  Thanks
to Peter Ehrenberg for report.


New in v0.2.0 (2002/09/29)
--------------------------
(Thanks to Peter Ehrenberg for his valuable suggestions on many of the
below.)

** IMPORTANT ** New syntax intended to make duplicity more
user-friendly.  Old duplicity invocation will not work so change your
scripts and read the man page.

By default no local archive dir will be read or created.
$HOME/.duplicity has no special significance.  However, one can be
specified with --archive-dir for faster operation.

If PASSPHRASE environment variable not set, ask user for passphrase
instead of exiting.

The source directory and hostname are now recorded, and rdiff-backup
will complain if you try to back up different directories to the same
location (but --allow-source-mismatch can override).

Changed some of the logging verbosity levels.  Level 5 now lists files
being backed up.

Fixed large file problems.  Files larger than 2GB should be backed up
correctly.

Significant additions to the manual page.

By default, duplicity now chooses whether to make a full or
incremental backup depending on whether up-to-date signatures can be
found on the remote side or local archive directory.  Overrideable
with (-f/--full and -i/--incremental).


New in v0.1.1 (2002/09/16)
--------------------------
Supports asymmetric encryption with GPG public keys using the
--encrypt-key option.

Added option --sign-key.  When backing up, files are signed with the
given key.  When restoring, remote files are required to be signed by
given key.

Now duplicity checks the hash data found in the manifest file.  The
previous version generated SHA1 hashes but did not check them when
restoring.

Fixed GnuPG broken pipe error.  In the previous version certain
partial restores would end with a spurious GnuPG error message.


New in v0.1.0 (2002/08/26)
--------------------------
First real version.
