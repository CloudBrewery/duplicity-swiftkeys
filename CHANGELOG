New in v0.4.1 (2003/08/09)
--------------------------

Applied (version of) Helmut Schneider's patch to display file mod
times with --list-current-files.

Fixed bug found by Rob Browning handling symlinks with long names that
have long names.

Applied Stephen Isard's patch to fix exclude-globbing-filelist.

Applied Sebastian Wilhelmi's patches to add rsync as a backend.

To improve large file performance, signature block size is now based
on file length.

duplicity should now build with librsync 0.9.6.  Much thanks to
Donovan Baarda for his work in this version of librsync.

duplicity should work with Python 2.3 now.


New in v0.4.0 (2002/11/30)
--------------------------

Changed restore procedure to download volumes from all backup sets
simultaneously.

Changed the verbosity level of some messages to 5, so level 4 is
cleaner.

Added --verify option, for checking whether a backup is up-to-date, or
to see what has changed since that backup.

GPG no longer needed: with --no-encryption option duplicity will write
gzipped volumes.  The checksums of volumes will still be verified, but
this will not stop a malicious attack because the manifest files can
be easily updated.

Earlier versions could crash when doing an incremental backup where no
files had changed.


New in v0.3.1 (2002/11/17)
--------------------------

Now by default the most recent files get restored, not the oldest.
You can get the old weird behavior by specifying --restore-time 1 (or
any other very early time).

Fixed a couple bugs where duplicity would crash if it found the remote
directory corrupted in various ways (for instance, if it contained a
file that looked like a duplicity file but had an invalid time
string).

Added --cleanup option, for deleting the files that may accumulate if
a duplicity session is aborted after it has uploaded some files.

Added --remove-older-than option, for safely deleting backup sets
older than the given time.

Suppress GPG log messages like "gpg: CAST5 encrypted data" if
verbosity is set to 3 or less.

short-filenames get even shorter---now use base 36 (0-9 and a-z) for
times and volume numbers.  This change is not backwards compatible but
probably I'm the only one affected.  If not, let me know and I can
probably write a little script.

Improved the way files are packed into the volumes so less space is
wasted per volume.

Decreased default volume size to 5MB (from 50MB) in preparation for
the new restore system planned for 0.4.0.


New in v0.3.0 (2002/11/10)
--------------------------

Added ftp backend.  Now the remote repository can accessed by ftp and
can be specified like "ftp://user@foo.bar/".

Added --ssh-command and --scp-command options, which can be used to
replace ssh and scp, or pass different arguments to them.  Requested
by Will Dyson.

Added --short-filenames option, for use when uploading to a file
system that can't have filenames longer than 30 characters (e.g. Mac
OS 8).

Added --list-current-files mode, which lists the files currently at
the given destination url.

Ported some statistics code from rdiff-backup.  Now by default
statistics are printed after a backup session.  This can be disabled
with the --no-print-statistics option.  Thanks to Mathieu Doidy for
requesting the above two features.

Added rdiff-backup-style --include/exclude-filelist-globbing options.
Now filelists with "+ /- " can be treated exactly like repeated
--include or --exclude options.

Fixed bug backing up normal files instead of directories.  Thanks to
Mathieu Doidy for bug report.


New in v0.2.1 (2002/10/31)
--------------------------

Security Fix:  Fixed bug where an rdiffdir patch containing a path
with a '..' component could overwrite files in parent directory.

Fixed bug where files without a username (only uid) would be marked as
changed every session.  Thanks to Peter Ehrenberg for bug report.

Now files with negative mtimes are treated as if they have mtime 0.
This prevents them from being marked as changed unnecessarily.  Thanks
to Peter Ehrenberg for report.


New in v0.2.0 (2002/09/29)
--------------------------

(Thanks to Peter Ehrenberg for his valuable suggestions on many of the
below.)

** IMPORTANT ** New syntax intended to make duplicity more
user-friendly.  Old duplicity invocation will not work so change your
scripts and read the man page.

By default no local archive dir will be read or created.
$HOME/.duplicity has no special significance.  However, one can be
specified with --archive-dir for faster operation.

If PASSPHRASE environment variable not set, ask user for passphrase
instead of exiting.

The source directory and hostname are now recorded, and rdiff-backup
will complain if you try to back up different directories to the same
location (but --allow-source-mismatch can override).

Changed some of the logging verbosity levels.  Level 5 now lists files
being backed up.

Fixed large file problems.  Files larger than 2GB should be backed up
correctly.

Significant additions to the manual page.

By default, duplicity now chooses whether to make a full or
incremental backup depending on whether up-to-date signatures can be
found on the remote side or local archive directory.  Overrideable
with (-f/--full and -i/--incremental).


New in v0.1.1 (2002/09/16)
--------------------------

Supports asymmetric encryption with GPG public keys using the
--encrypt-key option.

Added option --sign-key.  When backing up, files are signed with the
given key.  When restoring, remote files are required to be signed by
given key.

Now duplicity checks the hash data found in the manifest file.  The
previous version generated SHA1 hashes but did not check them when
restoring.

Fixed GnuPG broken pipe error.  In the previous version certain
partial restores would end with a spurious GnuPG error message.


New in v0.1.0 (2002/08/26)
--------------------------

First real version.
