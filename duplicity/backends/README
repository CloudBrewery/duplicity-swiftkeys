= How to write a backend, in five easy steps! =

There are five main methods you want to implement:

__init__  - Initial setup
_get      - Get one file
_put      - Upload one file
_list     - List all files in the backend
_delete   - Delete one file

There are other methods you may optionally implement:

_delete_list
_query
_query_list
_retry_cleanup
_error_code
_move
_close

== Subclassing ==

Always subclass from duplicity.backend.Backend

== Registering ==

You can register your class as a single backend like so:

duplicity.backend.register_backend("foo", FooBackend)

This will allow a URL like so: foo://hostname/path

Or you can register your class as a meta backend like so:
duplicity.backend.register_prefix_backend("bar", BarBackend)

Which will allow a URL like so: bar+foo://hostname/path and your class will
be passed the inner URL to either interpret how you like or create a new
inner backend instance with duplicity.backend.get_backend(url).

== Naming ==

When writing helper methods for your class, please prefix them with two
underscores.  While you can define other no- or single-underscore prefixed
methods, we don't guarantee that that method name won't later be used
by the main Backend class.
